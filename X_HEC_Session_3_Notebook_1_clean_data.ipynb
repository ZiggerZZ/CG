I have not been able attend the spa the last 2 years as prices have risen to unaffordable amounts.Booking prices of activities can only be viewed once you have committed to a stay and have a booking reference. The villa was tired and dated and the oven did not cook evenly.On a positive note the beautiful surroundings and pool cost nothing once you have paid the rather high price in holiday season to stay. October half term is now out if the question price wise with the opening of the new slide.I would always try to pack plenty more food and drinks to allow us to have a stress free pleasurable break and not worry about spending money if we decide to stay again. </td>\n",

It was fantastic. Every staff member we came across from check in to house keeping to activity instructor to hot tub maintenance were above and beyond. Shout out to Charlie the Segway instructor. We all enjoyed a range of activities, badminton in the morning, archery, Segway, laser clay shoot and swimming. All were thoroughly enjoyed from ages 8 to 70. We loved the location of 901, secluded in a cul de sac of 3 lodges slap bang in the middle of the park with equal walking distance to the sports centre and the swimming plaza. Our bikes didn\\u2019t get much of a look in. Everything was clean and tidy, well laid out and just an absolute pleasure to spend the weekend at. Free Wi-fi was spot on throughout the entire weekend.I was a bit dubious about the dining at Centre Parcs but again, everything exceeded expectations. Bella Italia (the waiter Alessio is a diamond). Beers and burgers at the sports bar, The pancake house was delicious and the takeaway/dining in provided a fantastic curry for us to enjoy in our lodge on the last night. Every front of House staff we interacted with were very polite and helpful. I thought things would get a bit crazy when there was an hour wait for a table at the Pancake house on Sunday morning but the staff were unflappable.All in all an awesome experience and we will definitely be back again. </td>\n",

Our woodland lodge was extremely well presented although a lack of a few essentials like a dishcloth or kitchen roll was missed. We hired two adult bikes (brought two kids bikes with us) and a child trailer and that was brilliant. It\\'s pricey, no denying that, and some of the service in the Pancake House and Dexters was pretty slow but the DineIN and Hucks services were much better experiencesBUT...and its regrettable we need to mention it but on our final night, our two year old daughter was very ill throughout the night continuously being sick. Not what you want in strange house! Within 24 hours of getting home on the Monday our 6 year old son, 9 year old son and both my wife and I were all violently sick, amazingly all being struck down by it around the same time. Without any proof, it\\'s hard to say but we can only assume the pool (Subtropical Swimming Paradise) was to blame. We are confident we are able to rule out any food service related cause because of the &quot;incubation&quot; period so we do think the cleanliness of the pool / showers might be to blame.I am afraid it was a truly horrible experience for the whole family to be ill at the same time resulting in  time off school (in first week of new school year) and time off work. It\\'s left, literally, a bitter taste for us which is a shame. I have logged a call with Guest Services who claim there were no other reports but if it was the pool, I refuse to believe we were and are the only family to have been so violently affected by this horrible bug. If anyone else staying on or around 2,3 and 4 September have experienced a similar illness, they need to know.......Such a shame</td>\n",

On arrival we drove up to our executive lodge to unload. My first impressions were of a beautiful setting, but with very uninspiring looking lodges. They were a mixture of wood and yellow painted boxes. Once inside however they were spacious with a well designed kitchen area, en-suite bedrooms, sauna and real fire. Outside was a BBQ with table and chairs.Once unloaded we took the car back to the car park and walked back to the lodge 30mins. There is a land train which runs every 15mins, but does a complete circuit of the whole area and can take a long time to get to where you want to be. It is very hilly and not for those who may have trouble walking about. A large number of people had come with bike racks on their cars and this is a perfect place for those families who all cycle together. My daughter ordered a bike with baby carriage and a childrens bike for my grandaughter \\u00a3100 for the week!We were unlucky with the weather and so sought out the activities available. To say they were expensive is an understatement! e.g. 2 children painting a pot (money box) each for 1 1/2 hours \\u00a340. My daughter and the children did several activities a day and made use of the swimming dome (which is free and is very good)We ventured out to the Longleat Safari Parc  and paid approx. \\u00a3150 for a two day pass (2 seniors, 1 adult, 1 child and one child under 3). It was wonderful and included everything in the price.  This was by far the best value thing we did on holiday.We ended up spending more money for one week in England than we normally do for 2 weeks at the same time of year in Italy in a 4* hotel with flights.

The site was clean and I didn\\'t see one bit of rubbish on the grounds at any stage of the holiday. We stayed in the Rosewood Apartments and on arrival, were very happy with the standard of cleanliness. The only thing I can fault is that the sports bar in the Jardin De Sports centre was selling flat foster beer on tap and didn\\'t take this off the tap and the girls behind the bar were very abrupt when I pointed out to them that the beer wasn\\'t right.

      "2018-11-19 00:00:00 it has been our family tradition to visit winter wonderland every year since our son was young and he\\'s now nearly 19, so you could say we love it here :) tried to save some money and visit right at the start of winter wonderland and, whilst the decorations around the village are lovely it doesn\\'t feel the same as in december. we started our break in the spa, i understand they are giving it a significant upgrade so there was some work going on. the spa was enjoyable and relaxing, nice touch to have staff members offering complimentary face packs. due to the predicted wet weather i booked a lot more indoor activities than usual, it is advisable to pre-book as the popular time slots can go quickly. enjoyed trying new activities of football pool (cheap at \\u00a310 for 45 minutes and good for everyone as no skill needed) and locked in a room, this was rather expensive but enjoyable as we had not tried anything like this before, no spoilers but was better than i was expecting. we ate at bella italia, las iguanas, dexters and hucks and in the main the service was prompt, with good quality food. it was a nice touch to be offered a discount for a repeat visit to one of the 3 chains (bella italia, caf\\u00e9 rouge or las iguanas) and save a bit of money.our favourite activity was feeding the reindeer, whilst this was really aimed at the younger children it was lovely. in years gone by you didn\\'t have to book this as an activity and you could buy a cup of food from the shop, i understand they need to monitor the food but it seems to be a shame to charge. our villa (pine 299) was fantastic, we didn\\'t pay to choose so were surprised to get a villa so close to everything (usually \\u00a365) short walk to pool and sports plaza and backs on to a small lake. we thoroughly enjoyed our break, particularly the fireworks which were the best ever and we have already booked for next december.\n",
      "2018-06-01 00:00:00 we visited in half term using a day pass to celebrate my birthday however although we are regular visitors to center parcs and longleat in particular we were very surprised at how busy it was given that they operate at 90%+ occupancy year round. the main problem was that we could not get a table for a meal in the evening, as day visitors we were unable to pre-book and given previous experience we thought there would be no problem getting a table for 3 if not at our favourite bella italia then at least one of the others.what we were unaware of was that hucks is currently closed for refurbishment (it says re-opening in summer 2018) so i\\'m guessing that everyone moved to one of the others but to find that bella italia, las iguanas, cafe rouge &amp; the foresters were all booked was very disappointing as i did not want to eat my birthday meal in the sports cafe mid pub quiz so sadly we left early.one other thing to note as a day visitor is that the locker system in the pool has changed and so if you are a visitor you cannot use a coin and must purchase a refundable wristband (\\u00a32) from either the reception area or pool desk, thankfully there was a notice in the foyer area as you enter the pool otherwise this could have been awkward. we spent an enjoyable day swimming, particularly enjoying the rapids and slides plus adventure golf and table tennis and had an unexpectedly good lunch at the pool cafe and dessert at the pancake house so an enjoyable, exhausting if slightly shorter than anticipated visit.can\\'t wait to return for a whole weekend break in november\n",
      "2016-12-17 00:00:00 visited for winter wonderland, this has become something of a tradition in our family and we can\\'t wait to relax and enjoy center parcs, it truly gets christmas started even if there are no little kids any more - who doesn\\'t love snow covered trees/walkways and the sight of real reindeeras usual we stayed in fir, the villa was cleaner than it has been in the past although we still found a baby\\'s sock under the sofa! we enjoyed long walks and swimming mainly with a spot of badminton but didn\\'t book any other activities as we have done most of them in the past and this time wanted to enjoy the peace and quiet without having to rush to another activity - bliss :)the food choices vary and although it is cheaper to take your own it is enjoyable to eat out and pre-booking the restaurants reduces the bill on the night as you pay \\u00a35 a head to reserve, food reviews:canopy caf\\u00e9 (within the pool) was surprisingly good quality but not cheap at \\u00a340+ for 4 burgers/hot dogs and chips &amp; drinksdexters good quality burgers about the same price as canopy caf\\u00e9 but small seating area, good for a pit stopbella italia - absolutely fantastic - great food, great seating area/ambience, good service and reasonable prices considering the quality of the foodlas iguanas - service let them down, very slow and food adequate (2 out of 8 dinners had to be returned to the kitchen) so overall disappointing but would try again in the hope of a better experience as menu looked goodsports caf\\u00e9 - love the new look and the fact there are more tv\\'s so you\\'re not battling to see the games, food was lovely particularly the cottage pie and good servicehigh point: the fireworks - amazing free display over the lake on sunday night with loud music and other entertainment and luckily this year no rainlow point: the cost of a stay but have still booked to come again year as once we\\'re there it feels like home and as our son gets older it actually gets more enjoyable\n",
      "2016-07-13 00:00:00 as a fan of center parcs i do get frustrated when people knock it especially when the reasons they give show they quite clearly have not done any research - i can only hope that people planning a break read the reviews and also look at the cp website before booking as all the info is out there visited longleat for a mid week break for the first time last month (we have visited longleat many many times but always for a weekend) loved being able to have even more time there as it is our favourite location - yes it is very hilly but for us this is the point of staying, we choose to stay in fir as we enjoy the long walk (approx. 1.3 miles to plaza/pool) but if you don\\'t want the walk or want to stay in a specific location then you can choose the location or even the villa number (additional charge applies) we do not want to pay any extra and so we always get put in fir but with no children under 16 and being in good health this suits us.we booked several activities in advance as this helps to spread the cost (you can book many weeks in advance and i tend to book one activity or restaurant a month) there are good value activities such as badminton, table tennis &amp; kayaking, we also try something new each time and this time enjoyed target archery - excellent run session and very inclusive; stand up paddleboarding which was great fun and enabled us to hire the boards later in the week plus we tried the electric boat.we ate out every evening as it is a holiday after all and i didn\\'t want to spend my holiday cooking even though the facilities exist in the villa. we were lucky enough to visit the new bella italia and it was fabulous although on the second occasion we did experience a hefty delay and so the bill was adjusted. note that when you place a restaurant reservation you pay \\u00a35 a head and this is deducted from the bill so another way of making your money go further one you are there. hucks was the usual american style food but we did order half sized portions as it mentions on the menu that most meals can be half sized for those less hungry and the chicken fajitas meal was plenty for both the adults and at a bargain price :).the sports caf\\u00e9 was undergoing some renovation so was smaller but we avoided the days the euro football games would be shown and got seated easily, very surprised at the quality of the cottage pie - it was fab, i wasn\\'t expecting such lovely food. we did use the parcmarket but only really for bread, milk and cakes (you need a little something to fuel your walk home from the pool) as we took pretty much everything we needed for cooked breakfasts and lunches, the parcmarket does have it all but some items can be at higher prices although it is handy to know you can get everything you need and they do deliver for free if you spend over \\u00a340.the villa itself was much cleaner on this visit although i did take extra dishwasher tablets (you are given 3 dishwasher tablets, a tea towel, a single sachet of washing up liquid and a scourer) and washed all the crockery and cutlery on arrival as wasn\\'t convinced it was properly clean. the site is undergoing some building work so some pathways near maple as closed and an alternative walkway is on the road so the land train has a new route to avoid the road but there are no more stops so the existing timetable is correct - a top tip if you find the plaza stop is always full as it is the most popular, turn right when you come out of the pool and walk to the stop before the plaza its only a short walk from the pool and you will get on easily.it was great to see the issues with the wave machine that we had in february have been sorted and the new waves are great, can\\'t wait to experience the new rides when they open next year. the pool was clean, warm and great as usual and a bonus for us was that the rapids were not too busy as it was mainly families with young children visiting and as you need to be able to swim to go down the rapids they avoided them but for us they are the most fun you can have as a family and the bruises we get are part of the fun.the weather wasn\\'t brilliant as it was rainy at times but we didn\\'t let that put us off although we were the only ones on the lake on one occasion! we love center parcs and had a fantastic family break with lots of walking, talking, eating and laughing and will be back for our usual pre-christmas weekend break in december so back to counting the days before our return .........\n",
      "2016-03-20 00:00:00 visited in february for our sons 16th birthday as this is his favourite place to visit (slight delay in posting a review as tripadvisor wouldn\\'t let us submit another review until now as posted a review from decembers trip and they don\\'t expect you to visit again within 3 months!) we stayed in fir as didn\\'t pay to select but villa 506 had a great location just at the top of the cascades, could have been cleaner and had to ask for dirty linen to be collected as left in doorway plus no oven glove or toilet rolls left - looks like the cleaners were in a rush - the issues were all sorted same day as mentioned to reception in the plazawe had 7 day visitors on the saturday and they mentioned there is a new system for day visitors and their own section of the car park which makes sense - always wondered how they monitored if day visitors ever left!as saturday was our sons birthday and one of our visitors we hired a cabana and decorated with bunting - when the life guard who showed us to the cabana noticed she brought us a cadbury flake cake plus a stack of paper plates and cutlery - we were amazed and very happy, this was a lovely and unexpected touch which made both the birthday boys feel very special the rapids were great fun as always although the new wave machine was a big disappointment especially when we had told visitors who had never visited before how good they were - i do hope center parcs resolve this issue quicklyvisited the pancake house for birthday lunch but despite pre-booking and mentioning birthdays there was no special treatment here and just put on a table in the far corner away from any view - the pancakes were nice except for the build your own which had very little in the way of toppings and was quite dry which considering it was my sons and it was his choice to go there on his birthday was a let downhad great fun playing badminton and chose to go canoeing for the first time which was an experience - didn\\'t think to take a change of clothes or a towel so the experience was slightly wetter than it need have been but good value activity and fun - lots of people on the lake in canoes, paddleborders, electric boats etc so you had to keep an eye out for other users but this made it more entertaining enjoyed several meals at canopy bar in pool, caf\\u00e9 rouge, hawtons and hucks - service was always with a smile even if the food varied in price/quality. the prices are not much higher than restaurants elsewhere but this was a special trip and i didn\\'t want to spend my valuable family time cooking and by the time you add activities its hard to find the time to go back to the villa to cook anyway but its personal choice and the villas are equipped if you want to cater for yourselveslook forward to returning in the summer for another trip :)\n",

      "2018-10-26 00:00:00 in years of going to cp, we\\'ve always preferred the original single storey executive lodges at longleat but found the standards of d\\u00e9cor/upkeep/furnishing had slipped beyond what was acceptable. therefore, no longer willing to stay in our usual 1 bedroom executive until a full refurbishment has taken place we tried a 2 bedroom &quot;new&quot; (refurbished) woodland lodge. this turned out to be a good move as the standard was generally very good with little to complain about! (note that i\\u2019m referring to the single storey original style executives - not the 2 storey or any newer types built or refurbished more recently - and i\\u2019m only referring to the newly refurbished woodland lodges.)if you too usually like to stay in the single storey executives and have also been considering a &quot;new&quot; woodland lodge instead, you may find this review of interest, as i\\u2019ll attempt to list the differences. if it\\'s just the 2 of you (or even 2 plus a small child) then you\\'ll probably notice very little difference between what you get in the old executive vs the \\u201cnew\\u201d woodland, and in some cases you\\u2019ll find that what you get in \\u201cnew\\u201d woodland is now better than old executive, making it a good alternative!the main differences between the two types of accommodation are that the \\u201cnew\\u201d woodland lodges \\u2026(1) have no maid service. (a bonus for us because it can sometimes be intrusive anyway.)(2) are not available with 1 bedroom. (no problem for us as we had an extra room!)(3) have no ensuite bathrooms, so you only get 1 bathroom in a 2 bedroom lodge. (fine if it\\'s just the 2 of you as you\\'d only have had 1 bathroom in a 1 bed executive anyway, but a compromise for 4 guests.)(4) do not have a separate bath and shower, and the bath doesn\\u2019t have hydro jets. as in executive, you still get a second toilet off the entrance lobby.(5) have larger tvs than executive in the lounge (i think 40\\u201d).(6) have a blu-ray player instead of the dvd you get in executive. they still have a media hub and wi-fi and a (small) tv in the master bedroom.(7) have a smaller master bedroom than executive. (not a huge issue for us given some of the other benefits, and for some possibly a bonus as it\\u2019s easier to heat in winter!)(8) have usb charging sockets. (not available last time we stayed in executive, so again another bonus.)(9) are generally not quite as close to the plaza as original executive. (however we were still an acceptable distance and worth a few more minutes flat walk for the benefits.)(10) are initially supplied with toilet paper but with no maid service this not replenished, and towels for a week\\u2019s stay were not changed.(11) have no wine chiller. (we can easily live without that given the other benefits!)(12) have no bar stools in the dining/kitchen area. (certainly no sacrifice as we never liked them!)both our woodland bedrooms had hairdryers which surprised me as i\\u2019d expect this in executive but maybe not necessarily in a woodland lodge.as lodge location is important to us, we always take care in choosing our lodge number, and had already worked out our preferred lodge location by walking around the site on a previous visit, checking the best lodges that were available for this break. it\\'s worth doing if you\\u2019re going for a longer stay and know the date you want to visit, to ensure you get the lodge that\\'s perfect for you. we picked one on the end of a row in a location that turned out to be reasonably private. i\\'ve said this before, but will repeat it again for anyone new to cp at longleat: if long walks/bike rides on possibly hilly terrain to the main facilities are not for you then please don\\'t leave your accommodation location to chance as this could make or break your holiday. this is unless you don\\'t mind waiting for the land train (not available on changeover daytimes) and appreciate that sometimes it will be full and you might have to wait for the next one.i\\'m giving this review 5 stars because we had a perfect break, helped by the refurbished accommodation. our goal was nothing more than to have a relaxing time chilling out after a very hectic run-up to the holiday. with regard to the upkeep of the lodge, it seemed a lot cleaner than we\\'ve had in the old executive (though we didn\\'t go looking under the sofa/beds or in the oven)! the lodges are not made with precision though and our bath tap was fitted at a very wonky angle (although it didn\\u2019t cause any issue). there was a bit of shoddy workmanship in the kitchen but nothing to put us off going again. many people love cp for all the activities, others book too many and wish they didn\\'t have such a hectic schedule, some love the pool. we just go for a rest and enjoy walking and watching the great abundance of wildlife on our patio. once again it didn\\'t disappoint with deer, friendly squirrels, various birds and a badger! a privilege to watch them at such close quarters from the comfort of our lodge. so, although cp can be a hive of activity in the main areas, once you\\u2019re in your lodge it\\u2019s also the perfect escape from hustle and bustle in a world detatched from the fast pace of everyday life.it\\'s a huge bonus that cp has such an excellent dog policy which ensures everyone can enjoy the holiday in peace, free to walk around without being troubled by dogs running loose and spoiling it for others, whilst also safeguarding the wildlife at the same time and ensuring children can play safely in woodland! this sets cp ahead of some other forest type holidays that are perhaps not so diligent. however, one thing cp has still not managed to tackle is stopping guests from leaving their cars outside their lodges for the entire break, yet back in the 1990s they achieved this perfectly. the worst offenders were at the weekend and there was not even a sign placed on the windscreens asking the owners to move their cars! it\\'s unfair for the majority of guests who stick to the rules, and spoils it for everyone. we had very good meals in las iguanas, hucks, and bella italia during this holiday, and also had breakfast once in both the pancake house and sports caf\\u00e9. absolutely no complaints and very friendly staff in all these places. we were disappointed, however, with dining in on this occasion. the non-cp run restaurants were offering discount against further meals after you\\u2019d purchased your first meal at full price, which really made it more cost-effective and we appreciated that.a little bonus for us was that our break was approx 4 weeks before the start of winter wonderland and so the staff had started putting up the christmas lights. although they were not switched on, there was the very rare occasion when you might find the odd one switched on randomly. whilst this is no reason to go before winter wonderland starts as they were very isolated incidents, it did give a taster of just how wonderful the forest might look on those breaks and at christmas, which we\\'d completely forgotten about! also, there were some nice christmas decorations to purchase from the gift shop!so, a great relaxing break and we\\'re already planning for our 30th year of holidaying at center parcs \\u2026 \\u201cnew\\u201d woodland lodge again, of course!\n",
      "2018-07-22 00:00:00 if you\\u2019re due to stay in or considering a penthouse apartment, i hope this might be helpful, as penthouse reviews seem to be scarce since there are only 4 of these apartments at longleat. with that in mind, this review will concentrate on the accommodation rather than our holiday and cp facilities in general \\u2026 though we had a very enjoyable stay!the pinewood apartments are very conveniently situated at the back of the plaza, so they\\u2019re great to quickly nip into the shops, restaurants, supermarket etc. they\\u2019re also quite close to the main car park. (the redwood apartments are further away near the village square.)as we\\u2019ve been going to cp for 28 years, we have a favourite accommodation style and location, like many other guests. however, we didn\\u2019t book our favourite 1 bedroom executive lodge in the central area this time due to the fact a refurbishment is long overdue and they are no longer of an acceptable standard to us. as we were celebrating a special occasion we treated ourselves to a (refurbished) penthouse apartment since we prefer a top floor and a separate lounge and bedroom (the penthouse is on the top two floors rather than the 1 bedroom apartments which are located on the ground and first floors). we stayed in number 17 pinewoods. as it was a short break this time, we were able to avoid the bother of driving round to unload. instead we just wheeled our suitcase the very short distance from the car park (we parked at the front of the main car park) and it worked really well. we ordered all our food/drink from the parc market on this occasion to save carrying anything from the car and it had already been delivered by the time we got into our accommodation at 3pm.the penthouse entrance is on the same level as you enter the apartment building, so no need to use the stairs/lift (which go down to the lower floors). it\\u2019s at the far left-hand end of the corridor. (the other pinewoods penthouse \\u2013 number 24 \\u2013 is at the far right-hand end.) as we\\u2019d expected, it was in good decorative order and well maintained. everything was clean and the bed linen nice and crisp. the penthouse apartment is spread over 2 floors and comes with a complimentary bottle of mo\\u00ebt &amp; chandon, small box of chocolates and a fresh flower arrangement (we had 2 small arrangements - one in the dining area and one in the bedroom). downstairs is the kitchen/dining area/lounge (open plan) with a covered balcony with table and chairs. the kitchen includes an oven, ceramic hob, microwave, dishwasher, fridge and wine cooler. i think there was a coffee machine but we didn\\u2019t use it and didn\\u2019t cater for ourselves so i can\\u2019t say what the condition of the oven and cookware etc was like. there\\u2019s a dining table and 4 chairs and an l shaped sofa in the lounge area plus (obviously) the tv and dvd player. interestingly there\\u2019s also a telephone (which they no longer have in the lodges). behind the door was the usual blackboard, though not really visible if you leave the door open. from the entrance hall you go up a step to the downstairs wc with a cleaning cupboard opposite. the curved staircase goes up to the bedroom, ensuite, separate shower and top balcony/sun deck with physiotherm infrared room. the bed, as you\\u2019d expect at cp, is larger than a standard double and comfortable. the bedroom is on the outside wall, so thankfully no adjoining neighbouring room. there\\u2019s a tv mounted on the bedroom wall and two bedside tables. our wardrobe had 6 coathangers plus 5 cubby holes outside it for further storage. the safe is on the wardrobe floor and there\\u2019s a dressing table with mirror and hairdryer. the bedroom windows can be opened wide if required. the ensuite has a wc, basin, spa bath (no overhead shower), illuminated mirror with shaver point and ladder towel rail, and again was in great order. the ventilation fan turns on/off immediately you switch the bathroom light on/off. there\\u2019s a separate shower cubicle in an alcove at the top of the stairs outside the bedroom but it\\u2019s open to view. i guess the purpose is for use after the physiotherm room, and having this shower plus the downstairs wc makes it almost like having 2 bathrooms when you both want to get ready at the same time. on the small landing near the bedroom/shower, a glass door leads out to the second balcony/sun deck, with 2 sunloungers and 2 chairs. it\\u2019s a very private balcony (unlike the one downstairs, which is overlooked) and the physiotherm infrared room is accessed from it. due to a heatwave we decided against trying the infrared room, but it was nice to relax on our very own sunloungers up amongst the trees!stairgates are in place (if needed) at the top and bottom of the stairs, whilst in the lounge there\\u2019s safety wires on the windows preventing them being opened too far because of the drop below, but these can be undone if necessary.observations or areas for improvement are as follows. note that many of these are minor but considering the cost of the penthouse, i think it\\u2019s fair to be a little picky.(a) lounge: (1) if you\\u2019re used to stretching out on the sofa you won\\u2019t find this one as long as the usual corner sofa in executive lodges (it\\u2019s too short for an adult to fully lay out on). (2) there\\u2019s no coffee table and only one side table. a little detail but it can be annoying for the person without a table their side, so that and the shorter sofa don\\u2019t make lounging on the sofa quite as comfy as usual. (b) bedroom/bathroom: (1) the bedroom is very compact so there\\u2019s no room for much else (eg. a cot). the 2 of us were fine as the bed was comfy and we had all we needed, but some may find it cramped. (2) it\\u2019s difficult to fully access the wardrobe as one door opens onto the bedside table. (3) it\\u2019s even more tricky to use the safe as there\\u2019s limited space to kneel down to read the numbers on it, so we gave up! (4) the bath has no shower spray so it\\u2019s difficult to rinse out after use. above it is a roof window which is left ajar and the occasional small bits of forest debris fall in the bath, so it\\u2019s not easy to wash the bits away. (5) the power and temperature of the separate shower at the top of the stairs wasn\\u2019t great.(c) general: (1) it\\u2019s nosier than staying in our usual lodge. you hear banging of apartment doors as they slam shut when let go. there\\u2019s a path to the lodges below not far from the balcony of this apartment so you can hear people walking past as well as the land train in the distance. deliveries also take place to the plaza behind these apartments, but to be honest you probably only hear most of this if you\\u2019re out on one of the balconies and none of it is excessive, except door slamming which is loud enough to wake you. (2) i can imagine some guests saying they\\u2019d expect bathrobes and slippers for the price paid as these days other hotels/holiday providers supply them in their premium accommodation. in the hot weather we weren\\u2019t bothered, but worth mentioning this for the price paid. (3) it was very hot in the bedroom at night during a heatwave, whereas we\\u2019ve stayed in the villas during hot spells and found them quite cool inside under the canopy of the trees.to sum up, we had a good stay in this apartment which we felt was fine for a short break, and it was nice to be staying in refurbished accommodation. there was nothing that would put me off staying in it again for a weekend, although our main reason for going to cp is the wildlife on the patio, so for that reason and the fact we usually stay longer we\\u2019ll try one of the refurbished woodland lodges next time. also, of course, there is no open fire or bbqs allowed (a consideration if that\\u2019s important to you). because the d\\u00e9cor and upkeep was good (plus we had a good and hassle-free stay) i feel this visit justified 5 stars, but have had to score less on previous visits to lodges that needed refurbishing.\n",
      "2017-07-09 00:00:00 we\\u2019ve been regular cp guests for the past 27 years so are very familiar with the cp ethos. things have obviously changed over the years to meet shifting customer needs, and indeed our own tastes have changed too, but we still find it to be a good holiday and one that\\u2019s difficult to replicate anywhere else in the uk because of its uniqueness. the choice is yours as to whether you do a little or a lot. although there are numerous activities on offer, you don\\u2019t have to do them.what\\u2019s always been unique to cp is the (virtually) traffic-free environment. unload at your lodge on arrival day and return your car to the car park where it remains for the whole holiday, thus keeping the site safe and traffic-free. most guests are more than familiar with this rule seeing as cp has operated in the uk for 30 years now, but surprisingly after all this time you still get a few thinking they\\u2019re above the rules by trying to leave their car outside their lodge or complaining about this rule as they didn\\u2019t realise! similarly, to also keep the site safe and tranquil for children, adults and wildlife alike, it\\u2019s a great bonus that dog owners at cp are responsible, so you don\\u2019t (usually) get unleashed dogs running wild frightening people and wildlife, nor barking incessantly and spoiling the tranquillity. (i say \\u201cusually\\u201d because on this break sadly we did witness an unaccompanied dog running loose including in the children\\u2019s playground, with no owner in sight, but this behaviour is very rare!) i mention these 2 important facts as some other holiday parks are not so thoughtful on these two points, which can really make a difference to the enjoyment for everyone. they are great plus points for cp and certainly reasons we return.if you\\u2019re new to cp and are considering your first holiday at longleat, before booking please have a think about how important it is for your accommodation to be near the plaza. so many times i\\u2019ve read reviews from guests complaining because their lodge was out the back of beyond and they had a long and hilly walk to the plaza or to go and collect their car on departure day. yes, it does cost more to select a lodge nearer the plaza but if it\\u2019s that important to you that it will make or break your holiday, then you need to seriously consider paying the extra to specify a lodge/area. also, for real tranquillity, study the map first and select a lodge which is off the main land train route (as they now run every quarter of an hour in the daytime). we always book a specific lodge in the \\u201cpine\\u201d area which is only a couple of minutes flat walk to the plaza, so we can nip in there whenever we feel like it (rather than have a lengthy walk/cycle or have to plan a trip to coincide with a land train). also, on arrival/departure days, ours is only a 10 min walk from/to the car park to return/collect the car. another consideration is to book the early arrival, if you want to get in your lodge earlier (2pm instead of 3pm) to avoid the rush. yes, all extra expense, but for us it\\u2019s money well spent. we don\\u2019t do any/many activities so what we save on not doing them we spend on these essential extras. we don\\u2019t bother with bike hire as the site is quite hilly and unless you\\u2019re really fit it limits the amount of places you can cycle to. we take some nice walks down the hill and catch the land train back up!we always stay in the original style executive lodge and adore the wildlife that comes to feed on our patio. this is another main draw for us, and again pretty unique to cp for the variety of animals that visit (it\\u2019s the only place we\\u2019ve seen badgers). over the past few years we\\u2019ve seen standards slip in the upkeep of the original lodges, as cp has been spending money on building new styles of lodges and pool upgrades, and it has been some time since the original single storey lodges were refitted. whilst most of our lodge was acceptable, the bathroom in particular was tired, musty and below the luxury we\\u2019ve come to expect of executive. it didn\\u2019t spoil the holiday and there was no need to make a complaint at the time as there was nothing that could be rectified short of a revamp. surprisingly though, other things in the lodge, in particular the sofa, were still in good condition and we even had a nice new lounge rug.our holidays are spent relaxing, reading, walking, playing adventure golf, and enjoying a few drinks and meals out. we also enjoy an evening in with a dvd and a log on the fire (even in summer)! evenings at cp are very low key with nothing staying open very late but we loved the new bar area at las iguanas, as longleat has never had much in the way of bars and this has comfortable booths in the bar area with a nice modern feel. the newly refurbished parcmarket looked nice and spacious, though prices are expensive. to be honest i never used to think or worry about the parcmarket prices and we always shopped there. however, this time we really noticed some of the prices, for example, a 2 litre bottle of mineral water at \\u00a31.75! in recent years we\\u2019ve sadly joined the ranks of those who visit morrisons to stock up with essentials first (something we\\u2019d never consider before)! we are not penny pinchers and accept that cp has a captive audience and prices will be more, but here are a few examples of bar prices, which we thought were quite steep. las iguanas: large pinot grigio (250ml) = \\u00a38.50. bottle of estrella (330ml) = \\u00a34.75. double morgans spiced &amp; cola = \\u00a37.20. grand caf\\u00e9: bottle of magners cider = \\u00a35.80. overall we had a lovely relaxing break - just what we wanted - and we still love cp after all these years. staff are still as friendly and helpful as ever, and the site itself is beautiful. an added benefit of being under the canopy of the trees in hot weather is that it always feels a lot cooler, and we actually didn\\u2019t realise how hot the weather was until we left! will be back again. would love to rate it 5 stars but again i can\\u2019t because the lodges could do with some attention, and a deep clean would not go amiss (we found a spider\\u2019s nest behind one of the blinds, which had obviously not been fully rolled up for some time).\n",
      "2016-07-15 00:00:00 we\\u2019ve been center parcs regulars since 1990, but this is the first time i\\u2019ve reviewed cp as there\\u2019s so much on site that it\\u2019s difficult to know where to begin with a review. we all have different demands and needs from a holiday but the purpose of our week was to get away from it all for complete relaxation. knowing the ropes so well, we opted for our favourite original style executive lodge close to the plaza, yet one that feels very secluded being on the end of a block with a long path to it. despite the different types of accommodation introduced over the years, we still prefer the single storey original style lodges for the seclusion and closeness to nature (even though they are joined together, the clever way they are staggered gives them a good deal of privacy). i know many guests begrudge paying extra to select their location but for us it\\u2019s necessary to ensure we are not allocated a lodge at the back of the site (necessitating lengthy/hilly walks to reach the plaza), so we leave nothing to chance and i believe it\\'s worth paying the extra if long walks to the central areas are likely to spoil your holiday! we recommend the 2pm early arrival option as well, to get the holiday off to a hassle-free start, and thus avoid the 3pm rush! over the years our tastes have naturally changed but nevertheless cp still fits the bill just as well. these days we\\u2019re content not to do any/many activities, preferring a relaxed break, taking strolls around the forest, reading, relaxing, a meal out, a bbq, or a cosy night in front of the fire with a dvd. (it was great that our amazon fire stick worked in the main tv too!) we also enjoy the adventure golf course, which is well maintained, and the ranger nature walks are inexpensive and quite interesting. the necessary use of disposable bbqs suits us fine as they are hygienic to cook on, plus there\\u2019s no mess or cleaning up afterwards. (we take our own foil bbq trays to use with them.) the wi-fi worked well in our lodge and we\\u2019re not at all concerned about the lack of mobile signal \\u2013 in fact in our case it\\u2019s a bonus as you can totally get away from phone calls, but there\\u2019s usually enough signal somewhere to send the odd unobtrusive text if you need to check up on anyone. one of our main reasons for choosing cp is the amazing wildlife that visits our patio, the relaxing forest environment, plus the accommodation. even though cp is a hive of activity in the main areas, you can still get away from all that if you want. another huge plus is that dog owners at cp are very responsible, so you can be confident when you\\u2019re out walking that you won\\u2019t get a dog bounding up to you and scaring your children, the peace of the forest is maintained, and the wildlife is not put in danger either.it\\u2019s been just over a year since our last visit, and we saw some changes this time. a big improvement for the safety and enjoyment of pedestrians and cyclists alike is that the boardwalk is now cycle-free as they have built a dedicated cycle route close to it. other investments have taken place such as falconry has been moved to the village square, there\\u2019s a new track for kiddies segways and another new path for pony rides. then of course there\\u2019s the ongoing work at the pool for the new water rides. the two storey executive lodges along the walk between the plaza and village square are being refurbished. good to see cp investing in existing accommodation, as we felt previously they were building new styles of accommodation but seemingly at the expense of the refurbishment programme, with some of the older accommodation needing attention. we were pleased to see the new bella italia restaurant and are excited about the other dining changes coming to longleat soon. (the sports caf\\u00e9 was in the process of being refurbished during our visit too, but still in operation.)to sum up, we came away totally relaxed and had a super week. cp has not lost its charm after all these years even though our tastes have changed. i would like to give it 5 stars (knowing their standards have always been high) but some of the accommodation, whilst clean and well maintained, is starting to show signs of wear. however, i must add, in our case it was minor and did not detract from a perfect getaway. thanks cp for a good week. we will of course be back!\n",

      "2018-08-31 00:00:00 we stayed here the last week of august 2018, from the bank holiday monday to the friday in pine 303, 2 bed exec lodge. we paid extra to choose this lodge, as we have stayed in the same lodge twice previously and it is perfect for us, not overlooked and very private, nestled in the trees and there is a small lake a minute walk from the back door. good location 10 mins walk to main plaza/swimming etc and about 10-15 mins walk to the sports plaza.my husband and i tried the new tropical cyclone water ride whilst our 5 yr old son was at a 3 hr creche session (chocolate chefs academy)- note:- the pool opens at 10am but the slides don\\'t open until 11am. slide was really good but a little short, would have liked it to be a few seconds longer but still was really fun! the new kids and toddler pool areas are lovely, air was a tad chilly but that can\\'t be helped, water was warm enough though.our son enjoyed the archery crossbows and the 4x4 driving school. danni on the 4x4 driving was lovely, really bubbly and cheerful and great with the children.we ate at sports cafe, hucks, bella italia and used the parc market once for some snacks, all very delicious! food at all places we ate was lovely but service at hucks was pretty slow this time. we always eat at hucks when we stay at cp but this was by far the longest wait we have experienced, unsure whether it was because they were busy and had some larger tables to cater for at once, but our waitress kept disappearing for 15/20 mins at a time and meant we had to wait each time we wanted to order drinks/dessert/food/bill/pay. our son had finished his buffet food before we had even ordered our meal! but hopefully this was just a one off blip and it won\\'t put us off returning to hucks again. also had dining in one evening which was also yummy!overall fantastic holiday again! so relaxing and perfect for families and children of all ages. (we travelled in the august school holidays and it was no busier than when we have been off peak during term time!) love centerparcs, will be returning again!\n",
      "2017-06-16 00:00:00 3rd time here in a year, we came last june (2016) for sons 3rd birthday and 2nd time in january 2017 and our 3rd time 12th june 2017 mon-fri. stayed in 2 bed executive villa 303 (previously 309 as it has been renumbered) which we paid extra to choose lodge as we had stayed in the same lodge back in january and loved the location, perfect sun trap on the patio and very private, garden not overlooked, 10 second walk to a lake too! we were really lucky with the weather this visit as it was really hot, dry and sunny every day so made the most of being outside. son loves the many play parks and boating lake, also the toddler area now refurbished in the swimming pool is lovely and our son thoroughly enjoyed the toddler slides. ate out at hucks (lovely fod and service, staff very friendly), bella italia (lovely food but unfortunately very slow service.. staff friendly but we were waiting 20 mins or so with our plates empty on our table after finishing our meal, waiting for our waiter who seemed to have disappeared so we had to ask another member of staff to look at dessert menu etc.. no one came round to ask how our meal was going either like the other restaurants in centerparcs do so we were a little disappointed with the service in bella only.. hopefully it was just a one off??), also ate at sports cafe (lovely food and very attentive staff.) dining in ( lovely food and perfectly on time for delivery slot!)really enjoyed couples dual treatment:harmony (massage/facial) in the spa and will definitely book this again when we next go to centerparcs.also when our maid found out that it was our sons 4th birthday on the tuesday of our stay (13th june) she arranged for a little present (teddy) and card to be left as a surprise for our son when we got back to the villa that evening. such a thoughtful touch. all the staff are very friendly and nothing is too much bother. we did the memorable imprint for 3 and i would definitely recommend this as it looks amazing! well worth the money for a precious memory forever.our son loved the crazy science lesson but as the session was fully booked only one adult allowed in per child so hubby went off to the sports bar for an hour and sat outside in the sun with a pint whilst myself and little one did some science experiments! it was very fun for both of us! also our son loved the chocolate chefs academy (3 hour creche session) whilst we went to spa for our treatment. the nursery staff are all lovely and friendly and you can trust that your child will be safe and well looked after.once again, thank you centerparcs for another amazing family holiday and we will be returning within the next year again!!\n",
      "2017-01-27 00:00:00 this was our 2nd visit to centerparcs longleat and again it was amazing. we last visited in june 2016 and thought we would go again for my birthday in jan 2017. the weather was cold, dry and fresh and meant we could snuggle up in front of the fire in the evenings.the parc market on site supermarket is very well stocked and has basically everything a larger supermarket has and not too badly priced considering it is the only supermarket on site. we did a food shop at morrisons in warminster the morning we checked in but completely forgot matches/lighter to be able to light our fire logs with! luckily we purchased this from the parc market and enjoyed a lovely roaring fire in the frosty chilly evenings!last time we stayed in a 4 bed exclusive villa with hot tub/games room/sauna for our anniversary and sons birthday but this time we thought we would try a 2 bed executive lodge no. 309 pine and it was absolutely lovely. perfect size for the 3 of us, very spacious, whirlpool jets in our ensuite bath and separate walk in shower and also our sons room had an ensuite walk in shower too. our patio was very private and not overlooked at all and there was a lake just behind the trees and shrubs outside the back of the lodge. very quiet area nestled in amongst the forest.we again enjoyed using the pool which is undergoing refurb at present and should be completed summer 2017. our son (3) enjoyed a 3 hr creche session on the tuesday whilst we tried out the aqua sana spa which was blissful! the dual serail mud treatment was lovely, would recommend this to couples! our son also did the mini trek course again (as he did it the last time we came) which he loved yet again and soccer school age 3-5 which was great fun for him even though there was only our son and one other little boy in the session, myself and my husband got involved in the training too which was very fun despite it being very cold that morning! there are fantastic outdoors play parks for all ages to enjoy and our son also enjoyed playing in the indoor play area in the sports cafe whilst waiting for our meals, which was actually very quick service considering it was really busy in there at lunchtime.meal at hucks was lovely and love the fact the little one can eat from the kids buffet straight away and there is also a play area and apple mac computers for kids to use, however we didn\\'t use this area as our son was absolutely fine with his colouring and sticker books. had dining in on 2 evenings, pizza very yummy and the chinese meal was delicious. the only criticism i have is that there is no lodge phone in pine 309 (we did have a lodge phone the last time we stayed in maple 944) and the mobile signal is terrible so i had to go outside the back of the lodge to find mobile signal to order the food and it was rather cold this particular evening but the meal made up for this minor detail. or you can go in to the dining in building to order food which is located in the village. we saw plenty of wildlife, lots of birds, ducks, squirrels and a few deer wondering past the back of our lodge. overall a fantastic getaway and we can\\'t wait to go back for our sons 4th birthday in june!\n",
      "2016-06-19 00:00:00 we stayed at centerparcs longleat forest mon 13/06/16 - fri 17/06/16 and it was an amazing first visit for us. perfect. we felt so relaxed on returning home and wished we could have stayed longer!myself, husband and just turned 3 year old son stayed in a 4 bed exclusive games lodge with steam room, sauna, hot tub and games room (villa maple 944). absolutely lovely location, very private and garden/hot tub not overlooked at all, modern interior and very spacious. it was only the 3 of us but as it was a joint celebration of mine and hubbys anniversary and our sons 3rd birthday we decided to splash out for all of the little extras included eg. hot tub/sauna!! it was so relaxing in the evening and even though we had mixed weather the hot tub was lovely in the rain/sun. even if the lodge was filled to the max occupancy of 8 people it would still feel extremely spacious. the bedrooms (all ensuites) and bathrooms were very clean and spacious too. we hired bikes and a trailer for our little one which our son really enjoyed. i was unsure before going which footwear to bring and ended up wearing my trainers for the most part as the site is very large and quite hilly, so we were either cycling or walking about which was lovely through the giant trees. we used the land train on one evening which was handy to see some of the other areas of the site.the pool and plaza complex was amazing! plenty to do indoors on a rainy day between the pool/plaza and jardin des sports. it was also lovely and warm in the plaza and pool. absolutely amazing for all ages and the toddler/kids area was brilliant for our son. loved the toddler slides although this area can get a bit crowded. i think it is currently undergoing renovations and the pool area should be bigger and better by 2017 however we thought it was amazing fun anyway. we went on the outdoor rapids numerous times whilst we had put son in a creche session (which he loved). the rapids are so so fun and a must! our son was too young to use rapids as you must be able to swim confidently on you own ie. without arm bands/being carried around etc. overall pool was awesome.we booked our son in on the tuesday for the woodland adventurer 3hr creche session and the thursday for pirate and princess party 3 hr session which he thoroughly enjoyed! he loved playing with the other children and playing party games and having his face painted. the staff in the activity den (where they hold the creche sessions) are lovely and very interactive with the children.the boating lake and beach is beautiful and plenty of outdoor play parks for all ages of children, many are placed around the lake/activity den area and are really nicely maintained. we went on the pedaloes which was a fun half hour.. and actually quite realxing as our son fell asleep in the front, it was very amusing and gave us a chuckle. our son did the mini trek and loved it, very well thought out for younger children who are just too small for the big high ropes courses, he also was given a little squirrel teddy after he completed the course which was a nice surprise.the jardin des sports complex has so many activities to do, again for all ages. we ate in the sports cafe about 3 times as it was very yummy food and there is also a small soft play and indoor toddler play area too which is handy when waiting for food, although to be honest we never had to wait more than 15/20 mins max for food to arrive and the staff were extremely attentive.we ate at hucks on our first evening which was delicious food and the childrens buffet was very handy as our son could eat straight away which was great! very much enjoyed one or two delicious starbucks coffee\\'s. there is a starbucks in the plaza and in the jardin des sports. we ordered dining in one evening, phoned them on the lodge phone at about 6pm and managed to get a delivery slot between 7.30pm-8pm. they do indian, chinese and pizzas plus a few other dishes. the dining in meal was also very delicious. we had a look in the parc market(on site supermarket) and it actually surprised me as it had basically everything a supermarket has! the prices were obviously slightly inflated but overall we found it a fairly priced shop for the convenience of last minute/forgotten items etc.overall to sum up our first centerparcs experience ever, it was perfect! it definitely suited us as a family and we absolutely adored the outdoors here in such a beautiful forest setting! so many walks and cycle ways and so many activities to do, you are spoilt for choice and it is up to you how much/little you want to do and want to spend! basically you can make it as cheap/expensive as you want!thank you centerparcs longleat and we will be back next year if not before!\n",

      "2018-09-06 00:00:00 after our previous visit in sept which was not a success, (building work, rapids closed, dirty villa) i was worried about this trip. i didn\\u2019t have to be, we had an amazing break. this time we stayed in fir 610 and our villa was lovely, we\\u2019ll defo stay there again if we go back. we loved riding our bikes around the park, fireworks were brilliant and the rapids were back to their best. one of the only negatives was that on our visit to santa, we had a particularly grumpy santa. there were 3 families all in together, and rather than acknowledging the kids he was ordering us what to do for photos. the kids didn\\u2019t seem to notice as they were too excited. but all of the adults came out saying how miserable he was, and he looks miserable in the photos and wasn\\u2019t very personable to the kids. this is our 3rd winter wonderland and the other photos we have of santa are amazing.. it\\u2019s a pity this one was spoilt.\n",

      "2017-09-12 00:00:00 we got back from cp yesterday and unfortunately on arrival our villa - pine 212 (which we paid extra to select due to travelling with my two disabled parents - who hadn\\'t been to cp before) was opposite a building site, we couldn\\'t park outside our villa as there were construction vehicles in the spaces, there was drilling/sawing/hammering going on, through the green camouflage hoardings we could see bright orange skips. lots of men walking round in fluorescent yellow vests. not what you expect when you go to live in a forest for a weekend. but what annoyed me more than anything was that we had no email or advance warning. (we booked in march, and it was obvious that the work had been going on for a while) i was so very disappointed and upset from the start as we\\'ve raved about how good, peaceful and quiet cp\\'s is to my parents. the building site combined with the rapids being shut on our last day was the final straw for me so i visited guest services to complain and to ask to be moved villas which i was told couldn\\'t happen, so i asked for compensation, we got a satisfactory amount in the end, but it involved me losing my temper and bursting into tears. again not a good way to start our holiday. and not what i expect from a premium product like center parcs. to look for the positives - after the initial upset on friday - we did still have an lovely break. even tho the weather wasn\\'t on our side. if you have young kids the new kids area is lovely, kept mine entertained for ages. and yesterday the little lazy river was much much faster than it ever has been. i quite enjoyed zipping round it with my eldest. i only did the big raft ride, and it was good fun, i was quite vocal on the way down, so i do think they\\'re a nice addition to the pool. tho i strongly feel they should be open for the entire opening hours of the subtropical swimming paradise. we love swimming in the evening and they close at 7, which seems silly to me. i\\'m going back mid november for winter wonderland, fingers crossed i avoid a building site and rapids are open by then.\n",

      "2017-12-29 00:00:00 magical at christmas, go for the whole experience. chalets need updating a bit, starting to look tired, and sports bar is expensive, but they have revamped the swimming area and that is great, though a bit cold in the children\\'s area for parents stood around watching little ones. the father christmas was amazing the best we have seen really made us adults believe!!!!\n",

      "2019-01-27 00:00:00 we\\'ve been coming for the new year celebrations at centre parcs for 9 years now, so we\\'ve seen the changes over that time and the ever-rising cost of the break. this year the biggest change was in the format of events on nye, with the impressive firework display being moved to 6:00pm from midnight and the usual conversion of the sports hall to an event venue not happening. whilst i can understand the view that the move of the fireworks to earlier allows younger children to see them, what it did do was leave a lack of any focus for adults to the celebrations after 6:15. the whole atmosphere was flat. anyway, for those not going at that time of year - there has obviously been continued investment in the park itself with lodge upgrades and new fences and pathways, but the overall offer is still the same as it always was with the addition of the flumes in the swimming complex (if you want to queue for 30 mins per ride). all of the staff are great, helpful and if they are running a specific activity, well trained and knowledgeable, however, in some areas there aren\\'t enough of them. the sports bar needs far more staff, when it\\'s full it holds hundreds of people and to have only 2 tills open is hopeless. we took to ordering 2 of everything to avoid the over 15 minute queues - and the prices for very average beer are steep. i don\\'t mean to sound totally negative as it\\'s a great holiday, we had a great time, but it\\'s not getting better and yet the prices continue to rise. it used to feel a bit exclusive because of the cost, but it doesn\\'t now, it feels like you are being milked and the people that go now are different as well - anyone going to a spa should know the general etiquette of being quiet as it\\'s a place to chill and relax, but those days have gone, with groups of guests feeling they have to reveal everything to all around in steam rooms, but again few staff, so no control of the environment. so to summarise: staff - great but not enough, activities - great, restaurants - plenty of choice but choose wisely if on a budget, lodges - good enough for what you want. so, farewell centre parcs that\\'s our last, but i wouldn\\'t dissuade anyone from trying it especially with small children who like swimming (free), but like iceland, understand you need deep pockets to get the most out of it.\n",
      "2018-02-18 00:00:00 back again for our annual new year stay. since last year they have obviously invested quite a lot in upgrading things. the new walkway by the pancake house, which is better and safer, lots of fencing renewal and the sports bar has had a complete upgrade. all of this is good, but you can tell how it\\'s paid for ... pretty much every activity has gone up, and not always by a just a couple of quid. we budget for this holiday and know what to expect, but be aware you will need fairly deep pockets if you have a family. having said that the place is still very good and the staff are always professional and friendly. our lodge was one that had been revamped since last year and even though it was just the standard grade lodge, it\\'s comfortable enough for an activity holiday where you don\\'t spend all your time in it. one improvement is the wifi which is now much better than it used to be. when you\\'re not doing something here you tend to be eating or drinking - all of the various outlets are decent, but none are what your would call &quot;value for money&quot;. a good thing is that the rajinda indian restaurant, although still pricey, has improved after a couple of years of decline. the sports bar has also improved with much better screens and more of them, but as it\\'s the nearest thing to a family pub on site it is difficult to see how they justify just under \\u00a35 for a pint of ok beer - a family of 4 will spend a fortune if they spend too long in there. it also needs more bar staff as it gets very busy in there. sad to say the grand cafe is no more. what was always a highlight for us, with the best food on site has gone. it\\'s been replaced by the forresters inn, which is basically pub grub, at restaurant prices, not in a pub ... go figure. it\\'s ok, but really nothing special. last thing, is that one of the things we have come to enjoy on new year\\'s eve is the firework display - it\\'s free, so can\\'t really complain as such, but it certainly wasn\\'t as good as previous years, so that\\'s not where the investment went. really don\\'t want to sound too negative and put anyone off - we are already booked for the same again this year. we love it; but being an annual regulars we can see the changes. we can afford it as we don\\'t have kids to pay for and we share a lodge, so we have a great time and i am sure most people will, but just be aware of what it might cost you.\n",
      "2017-01-07 00:00:00 back for our annual new year visit. we\\'ve been so many times we know what we expect and it\\'s interesting to see what has changed for better or worse. since last year they have obviously invested in tidying up things that were looking a bit tired, fresh paint and new lay-byes etc. our villa had definitely had an overhaul and it was in very good condition. the villa we have booked for next time is behind harding at the moment so the upgrades continue, which is a good thing. lots of trees have been removed which is a pity, but they\\'ve had a disease and they had to be removed, but there is evidence of new planting going on. a good addition is the cycle ramp beside the pancake house which means that the bikes and pedestrians no longer have to vie for space going up the hill. sad to say the rajinda restaurant continues to go down in terms of food and value, although the staff are quick and attentive, but next nye we won\\'t be going there again. grand cafe no longer do their amazing breakfasts, but the breakfast at the cafe rouge is very good. a new water ride/flume is under construction and will come on line this year i believe, which i am sure will be as popular as the existing ones. we always have a cabana at the pool as it gets very busy at times and it gives you your own quiet(ish) space. so, overall we had a great time, but not everything has improved. the staff are great and the quad bikes and field archery were my favourite activities.\n",

      "2018-10-22 00:00:00 we have been going to longleat for years but this may be our last trip - i\\'m thinking of cancelling our new year trip as it was so very poor.accommodation is terrible. we had an executive two bed lodge. carpet in the bedroom was damp and smelly. place was portly maintained and the seating was woeful for four people. i complained and did get an armchair and lamp delivered. but sadly the plastic covered sofa remained. awful, uncomfortable and at over \\u00a3800 for three nights, the company should be ashamed.rajinda pradesh food was horrid, poorly cooked, tiny portions and staff who didn\\'t care. child\\'s burger at las iguanas was a burnt, flat disc of \\'meat\\' - literally inedible. staff didn\\'t care. sophie at customer services in the plaza was excellent. the shouty, rude and, frankly, aggressive colleague was not and needs to reconsider her career choice! activities are great - staff at archery and the boat house are helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. however, the accommodation needs significant investment. the company are taking people for a ride, charging 5 star prices for cheap and poorly maintained lodges.\n",
      "2018-05-17 00:00:00 we went with two other families, staying in separate accommodation. we stayed in one of the new three bed lodges with sauna (why, oh why, not a hot tub?) which is lovely. all new and clean which does put some of the other accommodation to shame. pool was great, climbing and laser combat good fun. service in sports cafe was very good. bella italia was rubbish - poor food, terrible service. deters kitchen was slow but food was good. pancake house - in my opinion it\\'s overpriced but the kids liked it. biggest gripe is good and restaurants. poor choice of restaurants (still miss ortega) so everywhere seems to sell burgers. las iguanas is ok by desperately need something different and exciting. bella italia feels tired.other than that, great break and we\\'ll be back\n",
      "2018-02-15 00:00:00 we are big fans of center parcs, usually going about four times a year. last minute half term weekend was pricey by pots of activities still available and the place didn\\'t feel too full. spa is wonderful. laser was great, even in the rain, crafty activities very good.but the accommodation is getting really shabby. dark, dated interiors (executive lodge) with grubby bathrooms, often poorly maintained. the newer accommodation is very nice indeed, but the price of the older lodges is way too high for what you actually get. please sort it out!\n",

      "2017-08-28 00:00:00 this was our 5th visit to longleat centre parcs, but this time we were really disappointed with the accommodation. we picked lodge 296 on booking, and were really pleased with the location. however, the interior of the lodge was dreadful. the 3rd bedroom absolutely stank - really old, musty curtains, a really really strong, horrible stink. it was so bad we couldn\\'t allow our young children to sleep in the room, and had to put the two single beds in the 2nd bedroom together and all 3 children had to squash up together - which wasn\\'t ideal. the 2nd bedroom also smelt musty, although leaving the door open did help reduce this quite a lot. the windows were old - lots of mildew/mould. just not up to a good enough standard for the price we paid. also cobwebs, and a faulty plug in the kitchen sink - simple things that shouldn\\'t really be missed. aside from this, we had great weather and so were able to spend as little time in the lodge as possible! the swimming was great, rapids partly closed, and they were completely shut for 30 mins every now and then which was annoying, but still, the pool was enjoyed by all. our 9 year absolutely loved the new slides, once was enough for me though, i\\'ll stick to the slow green tunnel slides! our younger two (3&amp;5) loved the younger childrens water area. cycle hire was good - we took bikes for our 9 &amp; 5 year old, but hired one along with a trailer for dad and 3 year old. bikes looked like they\\'d recently been replaced so all safe to ride, and this really is the best way to get around! it\\'s so safe for the children - definitely saw a big drop in the amount of vehicles travelling around the site this time so this was a big improvement!! the site in general was clean, no over flowing bins etc. we had one late afternoon meal at the pancake house, great service &amp; friendly staff. dad &amp; 9 year did tree trekking &amp; ariel adventure (again!) they just love that long zip wire over the lake at the end. 5 &amp; 3 year old booked onto the chocolate chefs academy - 3 hours of being chocolate chefs, games, fun &amp; all things chocolate - they had a fantastic time - highly recommend as a treat for little ones! staff there were fantastic! the children spent many hours at the two adventure play parks, one in the village square, and one down at the jardin de sports. lots of ice-creams and fun family time! we do really love our weekends at centre parcs, usually we have a weekend in the summer holidays and a weekend just before christmas, but i will be very concerned about the standard of the accommodation after this visit, and will seriously have to re-consider any future breaks.\n",
      "2016-12-19 00:00:00 this was our 2nd visit to winter wonderland and we had another fantastic weekend. we are a family of two adults, and three children ages 8, 4 and 3. we didn\\'t book until quite late and so there were only lodges on the far side still available but this wasn\\'t a problem. we picked lodge 632 on booking as it was close to a train stop, and we weren\\'t disappointed. spacious, 3 bedrooms, large bathroom and another toilet was plenty adequate for our family of 5. the trains are frequent, and pass every 20 minutes. our children came with scooters this time, instead of bikes as probably a bit too far for them to cycle to the swimming pool side of the complex, but scooters were fine for the short journey to the jardin de sports for the giant play area. we swam 4 times, including in the dark on the sunday evening when the pool was fairly quiet! pool was brilliant as always, and you didn\\'t notice the works going on around which will make the pool even better once finished next summer. we visited the pancake house, and booked a meal at hucks which was great for the children. we all enjoyed bowling too. the village square was beautiful, lots of lovely christmas lights, real reindeer, singing reindeer and of course, santas workshop! they children loved visiting him, and we weren\\'t rushed through even when our youngest was too scared to say hello, santa took his time talking to her, and persuaded her to have her photo taken. we love center parcs, it\\'s great for a weekend break with young children. we visited twice last year - summer and christmas time, and did the same this year. we can\\'t wait to return in the near future to spend time at the improved swimming pool!\n",
      "2016-07-25 00:00:00 we visited cp longleat last july, and last december and had such a great time we booked again for this year! we arrived around 10.15am, and didn\\'t have to queue to check in. collected the keys and drove into the carpark - we had already selected the lodge 120 in pinewoods, and so managed to park just behind the path that leads into this area so that when it was 3pm and time to unpack we could just wheel our bags along instead of moving the car and fighting with everyone else trying to leave the carpark at the same time! so after parking we walked along to the cycle centre where you can collect your hired bikes from 11am. we hired 2x mountain bikes as you definitely need the gears at longleat, and one child\\'s trailer that seated two little ones (4&amp;2), our eldest was 8 and we brought his bike from home. was quick and easy to collect the bikes which we had pre booked. we had a great holiday, we used the pool twice everyday, usually around 1.5 hours each time!always managed to get a family changing cubical. we found the pool area and changing rooms as clean and tidy as could be for such a busy time. lots of lifeguards dotted around both the indoor and outdoor pools, and keeping an eye on the indoor slides and outdoor rapids. great pool, and looks like the coming updates will be fantastic. our children loved both the adventure playgrounds at the village square, and down at the jardin de sports. 8 year old and dad took the ariel adventure challenge - an hour of tree trekking and challenges before finishing with an amazing zip wire over the lake! would certainly pay to do this again on a future holiday! i stayed below on the beach with our youngest two, who enjoyed playing in the sand, and in the smaller toddler play park. we only used land train for one visit to the jardin de sports, and walked back because one train had broken down and so when the train did come it was full to capacity - not the end of the world, our kids are used to walking so a 30 minute walk was fine for them. our children loved the selection of ice creams available - from treats in the plaza, or various ice cream stalls in the sports complex. we had breakfast at the pancake house before returning home on the monday, but otherwise didn\\'t use any restaurants apart from the dining in delivery service. yes the extra activities are expensive, we just pay for one as find we spend most of the time in the pool or bike riding. we didn\\'t stop from the moment we left the lodge after breakfast, until the kids were flat out in bed around 8.30pm! bike riding, swimming twice a day, parks, ice creams! a weekend full of family fun. we hope to return next summer, you can\\'t go wrong with a family weekend at center parcs.\n",

      "2018-07-22 00:00:00 we have been to all of the center parcs many times over the years and it is certainly a unique experience.the lodges are tired and despite the cleaners best efforts, look grimly.we saw very little wild life this time - a total of two squirrels and some ducks.it is expensive but you can take all your food with you and there are takeaways a two minute drive from the parc.the restaurants under the dome were unbearable because of the heat and i don\\'t know how the staff managed to work there.the changing room floor in the subtropical swimming pool was filthy the whole time.staff are generally very, very good. we had an ill 4 year old in the middle of the night and the security staff on duty brought us clean bedding and even made the bed - thank you.if you want a safe, family holiday with forest walks and quiet evenings then you can\\'t beat center parcs.longleat is very hilly with quite big distances between lodges and the plaza and so the landtrain is great but can get very full.\n",
      "2017-07-06 00:00:00 goodfriendly, helpful stafflovely woodland setting with lots of ducks, squirrels, rabbits and deer in an almost disney like setting.the poolchildren\\'s playgrounds especially on the zig zag down to the lake.not so goodthe price -\\u00a3800 for a three bedroom villa for three nights.bathrooms were damp and chilly and thin towels never dried out.villa was tired and threadbare,eating out is very expensive. for example a main course for four adults and one toddler and four drinks was over \\u00a3100.fir area is lovely but a forty minute walk to the plaza or 30 minutes on the land train. also a long walk back from the car park.toilets in the sports bar were disgusting.in the evening there are no toilets open between the plaza and the sports bar which is over a mile to walk. a long, long way with a desperate toddler.the replies from management on trip advisor to negative comments are generic and never address the problem - just we are sorry you did not enjoy your time.i do feel that center parcs is just a big money making machine with a captive audience.\n",
      "2016-07-10 00:00:00 the goodbeautiful location with lots of trees, ponds and associated wildlife. our villa was on the west side with over a mile to walk to the village centre but the walking, although hilly, was lovely. there is also a land train every 20 minutes.the whole park is spotlessly clean.lots of play areas for young children.the staff were all very friendly and helpful with the exception of the lady at the guest services desk in the plaza. i don\\'t think she wanted to be there.the swimming pool.the lake.the call centre staff.the bad!the villa(3 bed executive lodge) badly needed refurbishing. the rug in the sitting area was stained and dirty and the bathrooms were grubby. the towels never dry, once used they stay wet. we stay at c parcs twice a year and all the parcs seem to be spending money on bigger and posher villas and houses and ignoring the ones already there.the restaurants are expensive and you have to prebook.the fact that c parcs decide that a child of 2 needs their own bedroom which is another \\u00a3200 and in our case, the bedroom remained unused.taking advantage of the come back soon offer, it cost \\u00a329 to book the same villa a year in advance. it took the lady at the call centre approx 5 seconds to do this and on top of what you are already paying seems very greedy.longleat center parcs is very family friendly and we will be back but it does feel like a money making machine at times.\n",

      "2018-01-31 00:00:00 centre parcs always delivers on giving us a break to remember but this trip was the best ever(honeymoon)sarah in housekeeping was fantastic in every way. the girls in the pottery studio made it a honeymoon to remember by their kindness and outstanding service and guest services were amazing. 17 trips to disney world and this holiday experience will be very hard to beat.\n",
      "2017-05-15 00:00:00 this is our 2nd visit to longleat and it did mostly live up to our previous visit. only negatives were that the accommodation although classed as executive was very tired and sparse compared to previous apartment and on my partners birthday we wanted to invite friends to join us for a meal in the evening(they could not arrve until 8pm) and they could only come in if we paid \\u00a380. this seemed a shame as we would have been paying for a meal in the restaurant although i do appreciate it is hard to police visitors. also the shops close far to early when they have a captive audience.\n",

      "2016-05-31 00:00:00 overall this was a pretty good trip with a few exceptions. the lodge smelt musty and looked very tired. the service on our three out meals was pretty poor also with the sports cafe being an hour wait to be served and then 45 mins for food. that said everything else was great.\n",

      "2018-10-18 00:00:00 the lodge we have is in a very good position , close to the plaza. but it is very tired, and needs a revamp. dont plan on cooking anything in the oven, it takes ages to cook anything!. the tv in the lounge is very small, too small for a large family to sit round, also the seating area isnt really big enough for the amount of people staying in the lodge.\n",
      "2017-10-29 00:00:00 we normally book the same lodge, due to the location, the last couple of times it has got very shabby, in need of some tlc now. we booked this because we like the rapids. and were told that they would open the weekend we were at centre parcs, but they never opened, now they are saying they wont be open until end november, to say we were disappointed is an understatement, because we were thinking of booking elsewhere, and really it was the rapids, that we booked for. also the forresters arms was shut, didnt open until the sunday evening we were coming away. centre parcs should not say that the rapids were going to be open, when they werent, i sent them an email which they said i would get a reply, nothing, i havnt heard a thing from them, some form of discount would be nice. as the rapids were shut, and several things werent working in our lodge!.especially as it was booked for my daughters birthday.i also found the mattress on the bed and pillows, really uncomfortable, i expect its because they are being used so much, and they are older now, so didnt sleep very well.\n",

      "2017-08-04 00:00:00 we have been visiting this site and others many times over about 20 years. my wife and i went there when we were just together and we have been loads of times with our kids. we know what to expect. we like that fact that we can avoid the airports, have the pool and are to some degree weather proof. the down side is that its expensive, which we knew before we booked and so you have to accept that. they used to have a loyalty programme a few years back but not anymore. whilst the staff are generally pleasant, over the years we have been unable to escape the growing feeling that centre parcs are taking the mickey out of us with their prices and don\\'t value repeat guests. this time we took the kids and only went for a midweek break. i have read comments on here recently about prices going up and though this must be from folks who haven\\'t visited in some time; we were last there a few months ago for a weekend break. whilst their prices were very high, surely they could not go any higher? wrong!the prices are now frankly ridiculous. \\u00a316 for a basic burger and a few chips! are you guys living in a different world? prices across the board have shot up in just a few months. we recon that they have gone up by between 20 and 40% depending upon where you go. we really liked las iguanas, and for example last time their cocktails started at \\u00a34.50 - they are now \\u00a36.50. in bournemouth las iguanas (which has just opened) the same drinks are 2 for \\u00a38.50. i could list other examples, but you get the point...it was the same with the activities we tried... \\u00a375 for a cabana for 3 hours, where all you get is freeview tv, coke and towels! on top of that the pool itself is now in generally poor condition, and as others have said, even the rapids were half closed. one of the other slides was also closed. my kids were really disappointed - the pool and the rides are about the only \\'free\\' thing there and its what the site is known for. when we complained, we were told that \\'the park was making improvements for future guests\\' which hardly made us feel better. we arrived early and went to the villa at about 2:30pm, which was still being \\'cleaned\\', well i say cleaned, the cleaner spend about 30 mins on her phone. it was a 3 bed executive was okay but a bit dirty and had a water leak which didn\\'t get fixed although they did send someone out to paint the ceiling in the lounge where the water dripped through. again, when we complained that we couldn\\'t use the shower in that room they said that they are at full occupancy so can\\'t fix many issues. that didn\\'t make up for the cobwebs everywhere and the un-hoovered floors.look, its not all bad. its very convenient and great if you have young kids and lots of cash, but if you want to feel you get any kind of value for money then really, its time to look elsewhere. i real think that centre parcs need to read these posts and listen to their customers especially the ones who have been going back and back over years. it all feels just a little arrogant - a real shame, but not too late to sort it out.\n",
      "2016-11-16 00:00:00 we have visited cp frequently over 20 years, as a couple and with kids. this last weekend we went away just the two of us to unwind. cp are trying to improve the site for which they should be commented, but the noise that it makes is really irritating if you are staying in the pinewood apartments. the construction is right next to the block and from our room it was all you could hear. no-one there seemed bothered and we were offered vouchers as compensation to spend during our trip which came through after we had left! given that a room for the weekend is over \\u00a3500 it really isn\\'t good enough especially when the offer is to relax and unwind. id advise anyone visiting to avoid paying for an overpriced hotel room next to a building site.\n",

      "2017-06-19 00:00:00 my husband and i were joined by his brother, sister in law and her sister for a 4 night stay at center parcs longleat.the two of us have previously been to the longleat site and earlier in the year to sherwood forest. the in laws had never been to a center parcs before but i knew they would love it.we stayed in fir 729 3 bed with a sauna. the accommodation was extremely clean and very well equipped. our housekeeping lady karen was very friendly and did a wonderful job of cleaning and replenishing things we had used. there wasn\\'t much wildlife to be seen up by the lodge as we were right up at the back next to the fence but we did have a couple of squirrels and birds and late on night a badger ambled by.we all hired bikes and we found the best (least hilly) way to get to our lodge. the wessex way path was beautiful and little used and a lovely ride to go down and not too bad to go up. you really do have to explore the site for the best routes. we used the land train on this visit as not everyone got on with the bikes. it is an extremely slow way to get round the site but very convenient after an exciting and busy day. on our way out one evening about 9ish we were lucky that we spotted a deer and the driver stopped so we could take some photos which was lovely!we only did a couple of activities, starting with the adventure golf. you really can not go wrong with this activity as it is such a giggle and all ages and abilities can have a laugh. we did the field archery with harry as our instructor &amp; he was by far the best we have had in the three times we have done it now! each of our party really enjoyed it and came away with really good memories. we spent an evening at the bowling alley, enjoying a few drinks in a good atmosphere making the most of the time together.we ate at hucks, the pancake house, dexters which were all fabulous with really good service, no-one was disappointed with their meals and would definitely use each again. now onto the reason for a 4 point review instead of 5. we love center parcs and the whole woodland layout, peaceful surroundings and the time to just chill with family and friends and we as a couple have never been disappointed with anything and do not begrudge paying slightly above the odds as it is usually a full package deal and other parks we have looked at even though are much cheaper, they do not have the subtropical swimming paradise. we had raved about the rapids and it is one of the big musts whilst we are choosing our holiday but unfortunately it was only working (very weakly) on one of our visits to the pool. i know it couldn\\'t really be helped but it really did let us down and the jewel in center parcs crown has definitely lost it\\'s sparkle for us. we were also told before booking last year that the new ride would be open by now but unfortunately not.all in all we all had a great time but may start looking at other places as i don\\'t want to fall out of love with center parcs and be one of those negative people naysaying everything. the staff are amazing, the layout is stunning and whatever the weather there is something for everyone.\n",
      "2016-05-12 00:00:00 we had never done a center parcs holiday before and were rather skeptical about booking. as a couple we thought it was all for the kids and there would be nothing for adults &amp; would be anything but a peaceful break. we were going to visit longleat safari park &amp; wanted to stay somewhere close so thought we\\'d give center parcs a go. so glad we did.booking was easy and i downloaded the helpful app straight away which really came in handy during our stay. being first timers, we were both nervous about our arrival and turned up about 11 o\\'clock. literally sailed through the arrivals lodge, parked our car and headed to pick up our bikes. it was so easy and within minutes we were off exploring the site. we managed to get half way round the site, find the location of our apartment and have a quick pint down the jardin des sports. finding our way around was easy and counted down the hours till we could drive on and unpack. accommodation - we had redwood 41 and pre-arrival i was worried that being on the middle level right next to the entrance to the building it would be noisy and hear people coming and going day and night but we didn\\'t hear a thing after check in day even-though we knew there was plenty of people in the building. it was a lovely little apartment, perfect size for us two and well kitted out with everything we needed for our break. there was a little debris on the floor, noodles, sweet wrappers and a champagne cork under the table but i soon cleaned them up and as long as the bedding and towels are clean we are happy. the location was perfect, the view from the balcony was stunning, trees, trees and more trees. no chance of being overlooked at all. we were treated to deer below us on a couple of mornings whilst we enjoyed our breakfast on the balcony and squirrels were in abundance! we both slept very well, not sure if it was the comfy bed or pure exhaustion from the days activities.eating - we took advantage of a couple of restaurants on site and weren\\'t disappointed. yes they are a bit pricey but hey you\\'re on holiday and hopefully if you have budgeted well it\\'s not an issue. you can always bring your own food and cook it so got a bit fed up with other people loudly complaining about prices, no one forces you to eat out! we went to hucks on our first night and were more than happy with the experience. staff were so accommodating and friendly. the food and alcoholic milkshakes were to die for, well worth a visit. we visited central cafe for my birthday as it was close to our accommodation, it was lovely but a carvery was a bit much after the day we had. we used the dining in facility twice and were thoroughly happy with the chinese banquet and pizza. we will definitely use them again! we visited the pancake house for breakfast one morning to set us up for a day of adventures and it certainly did. a fantastic setting to enjoy our pancakes and milkshakes and would have liked to have visited again but time was against us. we had a burger lunch down at jardin des sports which was just what we wanted. overall i think there is something for everyone food wise at center parcs, we did get some filled rolls from the parc market and i would definitely recommend the bakery section in there, yum yum!activities - you really can do as little or as much as you want! we booked the target archery and field archery before arrival. my husband has always wanted to give archery a go and to start with the target archery gave us a good understanding of the sport but the field archery was amazing we had such a good time. we were looking into booking more things to do but there was so much fun to be had on the bikes and in the pool that we just didn\\'t have the time. we did have a couple of games of pool and had late night bowling booked but had to cancel because we were just too exhausted. we took an electric boat out on the lake which was a very peaceful and pleasant way to spend half an hour and see the sites from a diferent angle. there are so many cycle tracks within this stunning site and exploring was so much fun. make sure you check out the giant redwoods, a sight to behold!subtropical swimming paradise - oh my goodness how much fun!!! i am a larger but active woman and was worried that it would just be full of kids and would not be any fun at all! how wrong was i! the rapids are amazing and i don\\'t think i have laughed so much in years. very scary the first time down but by the 30th time in our stay i had just about figured out the perfect line down. getting over the wall at the start is a challenge but we honestly couldn\\'t get enough of it. it gets quite busy but early evening is the best time to go. there is so much to do in the whole area, lovely flumes, wave pool, slides, very warm whirlpool and lots of areas for the smaller children to enjoy too. so exhausted from going up and down continuously. it was so much better than i could ever have dreamed! well done center parcs it certainly is the jewel in your crown.overall - you really can do as much or a little as you like, spend as much money or as little as you like. i honestly think there is something for everyone. the land train seemed like a good idea for those less active but there is just so much glorious spaces to discover on foot or by bike. all the staff we encountered were fabulous and really help to make your stay an enjoyable one. we have already booked another center parcs holiday, albeit at another site but will definitely be returning to longleat forest in the future, so many happy memories,. thank you center parcs so very much!\n",

      "2017-05-20 00:00:00 we stayed at center parcs on 15th may 2017 in 540 fir... once again it was a fantastic holiday! we had our two children (11months &amp; 3yrs) with us and as always center parcs didn\\'t disappoint! our 3 year old loved the cupcake decoration workshop and was well worth the price and our daughter loved the soft play in the jardin des sports. we ate at the pancake house 3 times as it was so lovely!! the only disappointment there is i ordered a breakfast pancake but just with sausage and beans - but instead of \\u00a37.85 they charged a make your own pancake for \\u00a36.85 and an additional \\u00a31.85 for the sausage making my pancake more expensive than the one with more filling. we also had dexters kitchen &amp; hucks.. hucks i was disappointed with this time as i didn\\'t enjoy the burger and the chips tasted like they were dipped in a pot of black pepper but i didn\\'t complain about this as my husband enjoyed his so just accepted it as one of those things. the children\\'s buffet in hucks was well worth the money as they gave us two plates so our youngest could have a small amount without having to pay for two buffets which was great. dexters kitchen was quiet hen we went in yet we waited longer for food as the staff we doing other jobs and didn\\'t realise our food was ready, again not a problem though as it was still a fair amount of time and the place was very clean and tidy &amp; well stocked. we ordered from dining in twice too which was lovely! reasonably priced and delivered exactly when they said it would be ! hot and fresh! we visited the swimming pool 3 times during our stay- fantastic as always but could do with more family changing rooms as the mixed ones are far ok small for children aswell.we had a great time in the bowling too! we went twice and at \\u00a320 for 45 minutes it\\'s great value! we got 2 full games in which makes it cheaper than your average bowling center. the children also received free ice creams from treats from bowling which was a lovely touch!we were happily surprised to have a bottle of wine and some chocolates waiting for us on arrival! the only down side about the accommodation was the dvd player didn\\'t work so we were very limited as to what we could watch- again not a huge problem as we were out a lot of the time\n",

      "2017-03-05 00:00:00 this was our 3rd visit and as always we had a fantastic time. lodge was clean and spacious with a nice welcome message on the chalk board which is a lovely touch. the birthday celebration pack i\\'d ordered was ready for us on arrival which we were very pleased with. always plenty to do for everyone, loved walking down to the lake with a picnic and feeding the ducks in the morning then swimming in the afternoon. they are extending the swimming pool facilities at the moment, we didn\\'t find this to be bothersome at all and can\\'t wait to come back when the work is completed. as always, eating out is quite pricey especially if alcohol is included but we come prepared for this and do a food shop before arrival and eat out evenings only. food and service at hucks was brilliant, would like to have tried las iguanas too but was always fully booked. we noticed a couple of hen parties during our visit, not that it bothered us but maybe some people might find it off putting and i was under the impression that center parcs don\\'t allow group bookings for stag/hens? also upon returning from a swim one afternoon we found our second door to the lodge was wide open after being certain we\\'d closed it. we later found a note saying we\\'d had a visit for a routine boiler check. we didn\\'t mind but perhaps some warning beforehand might have been appropriate. overall a great trip and looking forward to returning soon.\n",

      "2018-08-26 00:00:00 lovely break marred by a very officious spa worker making me put my kindle away - i have visited cp every year and,since i have had an e-reader approx 6 years, have always taken my kindle to the spa. its common to see people relaxing and reading their kindles and for it to be allowed for so long then just a rule enforced seems seriously silly on the grounds that this is not a camera, a pc, a phone its a book! i am not adverse to bringing in a paperback but actually can\\'t read print in a low light so won\\'t be returning as reading is a huge part of my spa experience particularly as i book a day session. i wish the \\'enforcer\\' had been as enthusiastic in telling the hen parties using the spa to pipe down, bu it seems some conduct (the one that actually mar other people\\'s experience) is ignored, while quietly reading an e-book is a no-no.\n",
      "2017-03-12 00:00:00 having decided not to return, i did and much needed renovations are ongoing. it is a beautiful village but spa seemed boring in comparison with woburn, but thankfully free of loud shouters and hen parties. food is way too expensive, more expensive than london, and on principle decided to just eat at home so stocked up at waitrose. i think this is something a lot of people are doing a steh restaurants not busy. the pool and rapids are great,as is the outdoor pool.\n",

      "2018-05-08 00:00:00 we always make sure we have a center parcs break for our anniversary each year (among other visits) and after a great visit to longleat last year we decided we wanted to go back this year. we booked the same accommodation as last year (a one bed exec lodge) as they are very comfortable, spacious, and have the extra touches that give a luxurious break. be warned though that lodge 273 is different to all the rest and this was our initial allocation! thanks to tracey in guest services and her manager jill for managing to sort out a lodge swap as there was one still available to ensure that we had what we booked. center parcs customer service at its very best as usual.once we were installed in the new lodge our break was as relaxed and comfortable as center parcs always is. we didn\\u2019t do many activities but there is no need to when you have such a lovely environment to wander around in and be at one with nature. we had deer front and back of the lodge every day, the usual ducks, rabbits and squirrels and birds galore including a great spotted woodpecker and at least two cats as well!the weather was varied and so allowed us to make use of the log fire and the bbq. our housekeeper ali did a great job and was really friendly.the stsp has had two new ring flume rides since our visit last year and are similar to those at other sites but with enhanced light and sounds and really added to the already great pool experience. daily visits of at least 2 hours, we really enjoyed the pool! center parcs longleat i think we\\u2019ll be making it three years running next year!\n",
      "2017-05-13 00:00:00 we came for a weekend break for our anniversary and stayed in a one bedroom executive lodge. we are regular center parcs visitors but have only been to longleat once before and stayed in the apartments. this break far exceeded expectations, the accommodation was by far the most spacious one bedroom accommodation in center parcs and to a very good standard as usual. having a bath and double shower in the bathroom was a nice touch. we were in lodge 310 and excellently placed near the edge of the forest but still not too far from the main areas of the park. when we arrived the wine fridge wasn\\'t working, i reported this on the way back from returning the car to the car park and within an hour we had a new one so we couldn\\'t fault the service for something that wasn\\'t an urgent matter at all.one of the big plus points of longleat is the pool area. the outside pool is huge, the rapids fun and the flumes fun too and with the new ones set to open later this year we can\\'t wait to go back and try them! the completely covered plaza area is different to most other sites and would give a good amount of undercover space if the weather wasn\\'t kind. as well as the usual center parcs restaurants this site also has las iguanas which is a bonus. the site is very spread out compared to the other sites with three very separate main areas and lots of hills (a land train runs all day except changeover days to help you get around if you need). there is also lots of wildlife and nature with the very impressive giant redwoods and monkey puzzle tree to go and see. we will definitely be back very soon but based on this visit we would definitely choose a one bedroom lodge rather than an apartment.\n",

      "2018-06-30 00:00:00 we stayed in late june along with three other families completing our party. the pool was wonderful, the younger kids loved the adventure bay/ harbour areas and the older (plus adults) loved the rapids and new slides. our lodge was okwe\\'ve been coming for years and nothing has changed! some things probably should! non stick frying pan please, or at least a decent one, the ovens are also sub par to cook with as they only seem to work turned to the highest temperature and you always need to leave things in 10 minutes longer. this seems consistent in any lodge we\\'ve stayed in. the fridge and cupboard hinges needed replacing (lodge 815) as they were caked with rust. the kids loved the land train which we made sure we used at least once a day, my oldest picking our the accommodation for our next centre parcs trip as we went round! we left the kids with our in-laws and had the evening spa and antipasti experience. pure bliss and would highly recommend. on thursday night all four families got together and had a meal at hucks, while the food and service was good the fact that they had no air conditioning on one of the hottest days of the year really spoilt it for us. we\\'ve always incorporated a visit to hucks before, but i\\'m sorry to say we won\\'t be again! no matter how good the food is we need to be comfortable. on the other hand our experience at the pancake house the following day was totally different, we chose to sit outside in the end but the restaurant where we waited to be seated was quiet cool. we look forward to booking our next visit, in different accommodation. overall center parcs longleat was a fantastic holiday, the kids were regularly exclaiming how amazed they were!\n",
      "2017-06-19 00:00:00 after a mix up at check we eventually settled into our accommodation. our lodge was faultlessly clean and typically centre parcs. we hired a bike and trailer, which the kids loved! especially as mummy had a pushchair and would try to race daddy! the land train was as ever, a huge hit with the kids, everything was just as wonderful as we remembered. on the second day my eldest son knocked his tooth out after tripping while running and as it was his first i asked patrick in guest services if he could make a certificate to commemerate it. he kindly obliged and also gave my son a toy which he was very proud of. he tells all his friends now how he lost his first tooth at centre parcs! the new adventure bay pool was lovely for the kids, my sons loved the big green slide. my daughter loved the lazy river. we ordered indian from dining in and it was really lovely. the week( mon-fri) went much too fast and we\\'re looking forward to going again next year, this time gor longer.\n",

      "2017-06-03 00:00:00 our second visit to longleat center parcs this time with our family who have older children, 7 and 9. there is heaps of fun to be had with this age range and active adults. tree top challenge is not for the faint hearted but the seven year old made it look very manageable. if anyone can\\'t manage it the helpful guides get you down via pulleys so it\\'s worth a try but fitness is essential as there is a lot of clambering up nets so have a good look before deciding. laser combat is great and the pool offers endless trips down the water slides of different kinds. the new extension to the pool slides is not up and running yet. we stayed in the ash area which is super close to the plaza and the car parks. plenty of cycling areas to be enjoyed but the paths down to the lake are steep and have lots of sharp bends so dismounting is often the safer option. not all cyclists think ahead and lots of little ones need wobble room.the cafes are expensive so buying your own food to prepare for eating in is a really good idea and barbecues are easy to do here. sports cafe down by the lake area had extremely slow service (same as last time) an hour and a quarter really is much too long to wait and a pre warning would have enabled us to go somewhere less busy. they made amends somewhat by knocking off the price of drinks.accommodation was roomy and clean enough but a bit scuffed here and there. maid service is great and efficient. the staff are brilliant on the whole. friendly and genuine and wanting to make the experience a good one. a big thank you to the kind person who found and handed in my purse (lost in the pool changing rooms). overall a great hol and will book to come again. not everyone knows that you can get to the cp car park early and use the facilities for the whole of the arrival day. so take bikes and swim things with you when you get there. check in to lodge later in the day. on the last day check out of lodge by 10 am but you can use the park all day long just leave car in car park. monday to friday really is monday to friday!\n",
      "2016-07-02 00:00:00 i have just returned from a four night stay at longleat forest with my husband and daughter\\'s family. it was a first for my husband and me. we stayed in an exec lodge (maple) with maid service (very useful). this location is great for proximity to shops and pool but is very hilly. son in law had his work cut out pulling two little ones uphill on the bike trailer. lodge was well appointed and clean. some parts looked newly refurbished, some a bit scuffed but overall good. oven efficient. hob has annoying controls which require a bit of working out. buttons have to be pressed in a certain sequence to make it work. beds maybe a bit soft but we all slept well in them. the outdoor area to the rear was rather boggy so we kept the little ones (4 yrs and an 18 months) away from it and the wattle fencing is a bit of an eyesore. the forest beyond is lovely so why hide it? the outer area to the front is also in need of a clean. bikes can be locked but no covered area so put plastic covers on your saddles to avoid being soaked next day. plenty for little ones to do - play areas are free and tasteful mini tree walks and slides on offer. the pool is brilliant and lovely warm water for tiny ones. very good pool attendants keeping an eye out for over boisterousness. the slides and flumes look amazing for confident older kids. you can hire towels \\u00a32 but they are available inside by the pool and that is not made very clear. big changing rooms are available for mums with little children. so handy - big enough for extra helping hands with slippery, wet children. big walk in driers cost a pound. spin driers for costumes twenty pence but not effective. pottery painting was fun. expensive but it is an expensive process so not a rip off. restaurants represented pretty good value for money in my view not as expensive as we had been led to believe. food tasty but service in the three we tried was very very slow so be prepared to wait or bring something to keep little ones amused- some provide colouring books. also shop was good and not as expensive as many say - not cheap either but not bad. overall a fun holiday will come back as a couple and try out some of the adventurous stuff. hope this has been helpful. final tip if you have bikes take one with you from and to car park to save walking as car park a distance away.\n",

      "2016-11-18 00:00:00 we visited center parcs during winter wonderland. our party included 4 adults and 1 20 month old. we stayed in villa 911 which is a 3 bed 2 storey house. the location was great - quiet as it was away from the main walkway to the plaza/village centre, and great to have 2 levels so we didn\\'t need to worry about being too noisy when our toddler was in bed. the villa was 15 minutes walk to the plaza and does include a big hill to walk up but this didn\\'t stop us doing it several times a day. we\\'d definitely choose to stay in the same location next time. the villa was very clean and modern and had no issues. we thought the plaza was great with some fantastic shops including a lovely gift/homeware type shop and a great toy shop. not overpriced either. the supermarket was also great, with such a wide selection of products and a bakery too (the cakes are a must!) we went to cafe rouge and las iguanas several times - both of which were lovely. we also went to leisure bowl and swimming several times. the pool is great for all ages, although the indoor lazy river is very vigorous, i wouldn\\'t go in it again especially with a toddler - it threw me into the walls several times. we also visited the spa for a spa experience session which was great value but a bit of a trek away. we did make the mistake of taking the land train on the way back. it literally goes round the houses. its quicker to walk! we also took our daughter to visit santa for the first time. again great value with a lovely gift and photo. she loved it. the beach area is also beautiful and worth a visit. one thing that must be mentioned is how friendly all the staff were. it\\'s rare in the uk to get such amazing customer service and friendly people. we loved our stay and can\\'t wait to come back next year.\n",

      "2018-02-13 00:00:00 me and my family regularly visit center parcs each year. every visit is different but still always enjoyable. this time we participated in the class clubercise which was amazing and really enjoyable for my family as most of us are over the 14 however suggestion for the instructor is to turn up before the class time to set up as we wasted 10 minutes of the class. also we only found out on our last day that the new slides are only open between a certain time for people who want to go swimming later this is not good as they shut at 7 whereas the pool shuts at 9. overall another good family trip\n",
      "2017-02-19 00:00:00 had a lovely time at centre parcs which was a mutual agreement shared between the whole family. there are lots of activities available for all ages, we hired a badminton court for an hour, table tennis for 45minutes and we did roller skating disco. we felt that these were good value for money whereas some other activities were not suitable for large families. we all really wanted to do the indoor climbing wall as it looked amazing but we didn\\'t have time. our lodge was only a 2 minute cycle from the plaza, 8 minutes cycle from the village square and about 20 minutes cycle to jardin de sports. we also hired bikes which for the weekend which were around \\u00a330 for an adult and around \\u00a320 for a child however i did find this pricey for long weekend considering you would hire them late on a friday and take them back before 11am on the monday. this was a minor detail and it didn\\'t effect the weekend.\n",

      "2018-02-15 00:00:00 we\\u2019ve been going to cp for years and usually have a great time and cannot fault much excepft the ridiculously high prices in the restaurants (which we now work around and take our own food for most meals) and for the activities which are hugely overpriced.this time we were really looking forward to trying the new flume rides and eagerly joined the queue in the morning to get into the swimming pool. it was only once we were inside that they said the rides were only open from 11-7 daily and people explained that they start queuing for them at about 1030 to make sure they do not have a 90 minute wait...... it was half term and so obviously busy and i expected the rides to be popular and therefore there to be some waiting time - but honestly - to limit the time the rides were open to then ensure the waiting was as bad as it could be with full capacity? management get your act together - no one goes to the swimming pool wanting to spend up to an hour waiting for a ride of a few seconds long! why are the rides not open whilst the swimming pool is open to serve the early birds and the latecomers in the evening rather than squashing us into the busiest times of the day?we did them a couple of times each but just got fed up with queueing and gave up in the end to go back to quality time together in the pool. i\\u2019m sure it could be done better if customer experience is put first - it has started to feel like a bit too much effort to keep ignoring the negatives to what was once a fab break - we are not planning to return for a while if ever i\\u2019m afraid.\n",
      "2017-02-21 00:00:00 my family love it here - 2 teenage boys who love the water and some amazing family memories. choosing the right times of day to go to the pool is the trick - and doing other stuff when the pool is busy makes things go smoothly. loved eating out and generally loved it all. accommodation has been updated since our last visit and we were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and comfort of it.my one huge gripe is the cost of everything - it\\'s all really expensive- staying, eating and shopping - i just feel ripped off all the time which is not good- doesn\\'t mean we couldn\\'t enjoy it but does leave a sour taste when you add it all up afterwards!! will go back as it\\'s great memories- but will start saving straight away!\n",

      "2017-05-20 00:00:00 we visited as a family in may (after already having stayed in september) and were really looking forward to returning. negatives first - the lodge wasn\\'t the cleanest when we got there. furniture had veneer missing/plastic trim missing. on the last day we checked under the sofa for toys etc. that my nephew may have pushed under and we found one of the trims under the sofa, along with tonnes of dust, dirt and rubbish. parts of the sofa aren\\'t even heavy, why could someone not lift it up now and then and clean underneath it? we also had to clean all of the cutlery on arrival, not only did it look dirty but it actually had chunks of food/dirt on it. the frying pan was absolutely disgusting. a 10-20 minute soak in hot water solved the problem instantly, why could that not have been done? we are expected to leave the lodge clean or get charged, you would expect to have it all clean when you arrived! my sister and i also visited the aqua sana for shellac manicures. we\\'d been before in september and my nails had lasted 5-6 weeks before chipping so we\\'d thought we\\'d try it again. waste of \\u00a329! my nails chipped within a couple of hours and i\\'d only been to the pancake house and the sports bar! they\\'re supposed to last at least 2-3 weeks. positives - you can quite easily spend a week there and not have to leave the site. you have everything you need there and there\\'s always a good atmosphere. some of the activities are pricey but you don\\'t necessarily need to do tonnes of the paid for activities. the pool is enough to keep you entertained for hours and i can\\'t wait to see the new rides open! they are constantly updating things and there\\'s tonnes of gardeners/ground keepers making sure the paths are clear of leafs etc. i\\'m sure we will be back again as it is a great family holiday location.\n",
      "2016-09-19 00:00:00 we went with my sister, her husband and their baby in september, monday to friday. overall it was a great venue but there were a few negatives; the new style 2 bedroom executive lodge we stayed in was mostly clean but one of the first things i noticed was the massive bit of biscuit on the top of the sofa, along with a dead moth. that stayed there all week even though we had house keeping most days. granted i could have moved it but i wanted to see how long they would leave it there. the bedrooms were also damp, all round the windows were black. the dishwasher stopped working on the day before our last day but before we\\'d even walked back from the plaza the maintenance guys had been in and were getting a new one so we couldn\\'t fault that whatsoever. my advice - take an oven tray or two! there was a roasting tin listed as \\'roasting tin/oven tray\\' but with four adults in the house it wasn\\'t the easiest when cooking! the times on the app and the website for things like restaurant opening times etc do not match up, for example the app says the pancake house is open from 11 so we planned our days around that only to find it is in fact open at 9. the food places at centre parcs are expensive, although you sort of expect that. we went to huck\\'s american bar and grill one night and for four main meals, one additional side and one drink each it was just under \\u00a3100 (the alcoholic drinks are \\u00a35+ each!). my sister and her husband went to have a sandwich at the grand cafe until they saw it was \\u00a38! the parc market supermarket is fairly reasonably priced so we used that quite a lot. the aqua sana is great but again the app does not give you the correct opening times or price list so it\\'s difficult to book. my sister and i booked for shellac nails, my sister already had shellac nails which needed to be removed first. the price listed was more than she would usually pay at home for removal and a new set of nails so we assumed it was for removal as well. when we got there she had to pay an extra \\u00a310 on top of the \\u00a329 already paid. the nails were then breaking only a couple of hours later. the parking when loading and unloading wasn\\'t brilliant. when the barrier was lifted at 3pm understandably everyone rushed at the same time to get a spot outside their accommodation. the problem being that a lot of people then left their cars there for hours meaning others, including ourselves, who hadn\\'t got a space were having to carry our luggage quite far. why have a no car rule then not enforce it? the activities are expensive too but it is what you make it. there\\'s plenty to do and see without spending any money. the subtropical pool is brilliant fun but do be careful on the rapids - we all ended up with some kind of injury. there is lots to do in the pool and they\\'re adding to it as well. the pathways and roads are constantly being swept, to avoid anyone slipping on the leaves i guess. the accommodation was plenty big enough for us 5, although we were misled on the zones map when booking! there\\'s always staff members on hand if you need anything. it sounds a lot of negatives but i would definitely go back again. it\\'s all very carefully laid out and relaxing, you just need to plan ahead with meals etc otherwise it all gets very expensive.\n",

      "2017-10-18 00:00:00 for a long time i have resisted booking a centre parc\\'s holiday, mainly because they seemed pricey. however, having now been on one i can confirm the cost is worth it.we had a standard woodland cabin which was clean, spacious (we had 6 in there), well equipped and had a pleasant scandinavian feel. it was a short walk to the main plaza and the land train from there.the pool area was excellent and entertained our children (and us) for hours. lots of space and not much queuing for the flumes.we booked a number of activities and each time found the staff running them well trained and knowledgeable. the equipment was well maintained and comparable with any stand alone commercial activity. my son did the aerial walkway and though similar price to a go ape i felt it offered more variety and challenges.getting round was easy, we generally used the land train, though the loop it did at the south west corner was time consuming so we generally walked across the park to catch it after it had made the detour.we found every member of staff helpful and accommodating, it was not unusual to find them going out of their way to help. a special mention to the ladies in the sports shop who opened 10 minutes early when my son discovered he\\'d forgotten his trainers. centre parcs must have excellent recruitment and training in customer service, even the cleaning and maintenance staff showed a customer centric attitude.if like me you\\'ve resisted centre parcs give it a go, you won\\'t be disappointed. we had a great time and have booked a return visit already.\n",

      "2018-01-02 00:00:00 this was our 4th trip to centre parcs but our first for the christmas break. as soon as we pulled into the driveway on day of arrival i knew we were in for a treat....the fake snow on the entrance sign gave such an instant christmassy feel. my 3.5 yr old son was so excited! as usual we headed straight to the villa at 2pm (having paid for the early arrival) and was pleasantly surprised to find a christmas card (from centre parcs), a small soft reindeer for my son (nutmeg) to keep (we ended up buying the accompanying book to go with it from parc market), a reindeer bag (also for my son) and a letter to post to santa. i left my husband and b-in-law to unpack the car whilst my sister, my son and i proceed to decorate the christmas tree (which we had paid to have delivered with a bauble / decs pack) - worth every penny! we noticed pretty early on that the sink and bath in the main bathroom took quite a while to drain away and by saturday morning the sink wasn\\'t draining at all. luckily some staff were doing the rounds and checking if everything was ok, we mentioned about the sink and bath and by the time we returned to the villa sat evening it was all fixed. the staff also very kindly gave my son a bag of gold chocolate coins. out and about as always was fantastic, leaving the car in the car park is just bliss. cycling all the cobwebs away, everyone we met was cheerful (whether staff or other visitors) and in true christmas spirit. the pools were great as always, restaurants and facilities so very family friendly (which is a huge plus for us with a 3.5 yr old). the village was decorated beautifully and really did feel like a magical winter wonderland. it was so pretty cycling around at night and seeing all the christmas lights everywhere. we booked my son in to see santa on christmas eve and this was a slight disappointment. it felt rather like a conveyor belt, waiting around in a small room before being led into the room with santa which was even smaller and soooo hot i\\'m surprised we didn\\'t melt. (luckily for us we had also been to see santa at marwell zoo the week before which was much better and great value for money), however, the plus is that the photo with santa is included in the price at cp\\'s. we had also posted the letter to santa (that was in the villa on arrival for us to fill out and post in the plaza) and was delighted when on christmas eve we found a personalised letter hanging on the front door for my son. to say he was overjoyed is an understatement - what a lovely moment and something we will keep! back to the villa - we had a 3 bed woodland lodge in the pine area and it was plenty big enough and comfortable for 4 adults and 1 child. cooking christmas dinner was a bit of a task as the oven isn\\'t overly big but we managed (thank goodness we had chicken instead of a huge turkey). our tree was shedding rather a lot of needles so we decided to run the hoover round, upon lifting the sofa\\'s it was clear that they had not been lifted before our arrival and we found food and all sorts (from previous guests underneath) - not nice. can only assume the cleaners did a quick job due to the mass arrival for the christmas break? even so, when you\\'ve paid a lot of money you expect cleanliness. the day we packed up i also found a pair of scissors on the top shelf of the wardrobe (which i heard moved as i was reaching for my clothes) - thank goodness they didn\\'t fall on me as they were large kitchen scissors, no idea why they were in the bedroom wardrobe and thankful my son hadn\\'t found them. then whilst packing up my sons bedroom we found a bra and pants set tucked underneath the desk - not ours! again, can only assume from previous guests, but just goes to show the cleaners don\\'t do a thorough clean as if the hoover had gone under the desk surely they would have found them? the only reason we didn\\'t find them till the day we left is because we had no use for the desk in my sons bedroom and came across them simply by double checking everywhere that we hadn\\'t left anything behind. quite grossed out by the fact that used underwear had been in my sons bedroom - yuck! i do wonder how often the villas are given a deep clean? so all in all we had a great time and i would recommend it to anyone....we have already booked to go back for a weekend in june and are considering christmas again next year (every other year as its expensive).\n",
      "2016-09-10 00:00:00 have just returned for our first trip to center parcs, longleat (4 adults and 1 toddler). we stayed in the pine area in a 3-bed woodland lodge. we booked to stay the week after the school holidays on purpose to avoid the masses so was quite surprised at how busy it was (people having the same idea as us i think). my hubby and i both said i couldn\\'t imagine coming during peek time as i don\\'t think there would actually be any room to move or swim in the pools! the trick we soon realised was to go to the pools in the evening around 6pm when it was quieter....yay!we paid for early check-in and was pleased to arrive at our villa to find it all set up and ready for us. it was very clean and spacious and was certainly roomy enough for 4 adults (ages 35-50) and one 2 year old toddler.we paid for 2 disposable bbqs which worked really well (and saved a lot of money).as this was our first trip we didn\\'t book any activities apart from my sister and i treating ourselves to a massage at aqua sana.there is so much to do that we\\'re glad we didn\\'t book any activities on this trip as it was nice to take everything in and get to know the place. we spent the day at longleat safari park which is just down the road and no one wanted to cook, nor did we want to walk any more when we got back to the lodge so we decided to order from &quot;dining in&quot; and have food delivered. its expensive!! 4 adults ordered 3 x thai green currys with rice and 1 x s&amp;s chicken with noodles and it came to \\u00a358. this is the most expensive take away we\\'ve ever had.aqua sana is amazing and i would really recommend this to anyone looking for somewhere to completely relax. i paid \\u00a375 (ouch!) for a full body wellness massage and whilst i think \\u00a375 is pretty expensive for a massage (usually expect to pay \\u00a350-\\u00a360), it was the best massage i have ever had. the aqua sana is fab and very relaxing. the staff are lovely and very friendly too.the swimming pools are great but the changing rooms and tiny and as mentioned above, i think it must be a complete nightmare in the &quot;busy season&quot; / school holidays. my hubby and i were extremely impressed with the lifeguard (who\\'s name i didn\\'t get) that responded so quickly when our 2 year old son slipped and fell over, hitting his head. the lifeguard came quickly with an ice bag in hand, spoke to our little boy, asked his name and our lodge number (to put in accident book) and checked his head for bumps etc. he was really kind and took the time to make sure we were all ok. our little boy soon wanted to go back in the water.we were surprised though at just how many rocks are pointing out of the water in slippery areas where kids (and adults) could easily fall against or hit heads. i know it looks great but was just a bit surprised. our woodland lodge was comfortable and spacious but as the days went on we all started to notice it felt quite damp. particularly in the bathroom and back bedroom. on the last day all my clothes (that were hung in the wardrobe) felt damp and smelt musty. i know we\\'re in the woods and all that, but there is no window in the bathroom (only a small extractor fan which is only on when the light is on) and the windows only open so far (for safety and security so shouldn\\'t really complain). all in all we had a great time and are already planning our next trip back.\n",

      "2016-08-29 00:00:00 a wonderful weekend - there is a feeling of space and privacy in the chalet even when it rained (it was great with the patio door open listening to the rain on the leaves, i felt very at-one with nature). loved: the plaza, riding our bikes, the jacuzzi bath, the well-equipped kitchen, and the wildlife including a deer. downside: it\\'s quite a hefty sum for a weekend, but i obviously think it\\'s worth it because i have rebooked for next year!\n",

      "2018-09-05 00:00:00 had another excellent time with the family...away in the stunning scenery, on the bikes and enjoying the fresh air. the only drawback, as with other center parcs, is the astronomical cost of activities and food/drink. cost of accommodation is very expensive too but likely to go again just for the sheer pleasure of the quality family time together. they can do more for you to go back?has \\u00a325 voucher to spent there means you spend more to get money off .(rubbish)what about \\u00a3100 off if you book again?bike hire was well worth it nice people and help full . would like more for my money\n",

      "2018-01-05 00:00:00 had the usual great mid week break, clean and well presented villa. all the facilities readily available, especially the new water rides, although a bit of a wait to go on. some nice meals to be had if a little pricey particularly beer prices. disapointing was the amountof \\'illegally\\' parked cars left around rather than returned to the car parks as required even though carded by security for the entire 5days. one other minor gripe was yet again thisyear the cascades was not functioning during our stay.\n",

      "2018-07-10 00:00:00 this is our third visit to centerparcs longleat. we arrived at centerparcs about 2pm and were given our wristbands and told to park up and the would be able access our accommodation at 3pm. this time we paid the bit extra to pick a villa closer to the swimming plaza and were only a about 300m away. on arrival we found our villa to be clean and tidy. we were at the end of a terrace and only had someone on one said and we heard no noise from them. we notced that about 2.45 people had started to return to their cars to queue to get to their accommodation. i would definately recommend just to take a few easy to carry items with you to your accomodation if you are closeby and then drive with the rest of your belongings when the madness is over. we unpacked quite quickly and headed straight for the swimming pool which was busy but not overly so. we used the parc market for a few bits and didnt think it was too overly priced. we had booked bella italia for the second night of our stay. it was not busy at all when we were there. the food was very good and very tasty and our waitress was exceptionally friendly. they are doing works around this area and unfortunately the windows could be opened and as it was the beginning of the wonderful &quot;heatwave&quot; was very uncomfortable. i really dont know how the staff didnt pass out. we ate in hucks on our last night, the food there was just okay. as two of our party are huge soccer fans we booked a cabana for one of the afternoons so they could keep an eye on the games. there was just four of us but there were seats for six with a selection of drinks, towels and a safe together with the tv. it was nice to have the use of it for a few hours. the kids also loved the new waterslides and we found if you went to the swimming pool at lunch time about 12.30 or so, there were hardly no queues at any of the rides. when we were leaving we were asked by the kids, when will we be going again - so it was obviously another hit with them !\n",
      "2016-05-12 00:00:00 this is our second stay at center parcs longleat. we arrived on the bank holiday monday and were staying in the fir area. no queue at check-in and we drove straight to our villa. we had no problems with our villa apart from the safe which would not lock. it did take three phone calls to sort this out and eventually the problem was sorted. we had booked strada for the first night and was very disappointed by it. the seats where we were sitting were torn and very tired looking. we were shown to our table quite quickly and we were just left ... and left ... it took a woeful about of time for somebody to take our order, even though it wasnt packed. food was very mediocre but we were starving. we did most of our food shop in the parc market and found it fine and had a couple of bbqs. the pool and slides etc. on the monday to friday were great. lovely and clean, no queues to speak of and full of families with children. our children had a great time in both the indoor and outdoor pools and rapids etc. we also ate in the sports bar and hucks and found both lovely. then the weekend came - what a difference, totally put a damper on things. full of very large groups, hens, stags, birthday parties, etc. on the walk back to our accommodation in the evening the noise and commotion going on in one or two of the villas which we passed was crazy, we were very thankful not to have been located any nearer to these villas and feel very sorry for anyone who was. i do have to say too that there was a birthday party or some celebration in our section too and these people were very respectful and didnt cause any problems at all. on the sunday we headed to the pool for our last day. we only lasted there for about 45 minutes or less. the floors were sopping wet and extremely slippy and my husband witnessed a lady take a hard fall. at one stage we were all told to get out of the indoor pool - i couldnt hear why and asked a lady beside me and she said she heard someone had gotten sick in the pool - it was a sunny day and the outside pool was extremely packed and it was too dangerous to let the kids head down the rapids as there were far to many people travelling down them at the same time - all in all, we enjoyed monday to friday : weekend - a big no. definately not good at the weekends and would avoid.\n",

      "2018-12-11 00:00:00 this was our second visit to center parcs longleat, intent on spending some time taking in the festivities. we booked a lodge in the pine area (which is perfect in terms of proximity to the plaza, village centre and sports centre). on arrival we were delighted to see how well the park has been decorated, which really was brilliant. our 2 year old daughter loved all the lights and they kept her occupied while we walked back and forth to the lodge. our lodge was as expected - had everything we required. one of the biggest bugbears for me was that the heating resets at midnight to 14 degrees, which left the lodge very cold by about 3am. while i appreciate the need to save energy, this was annoying and unnecessary. in terms of the activities, we booked our daughter on the festive kids party and the elf hunt. both of these things were heavily overbooked. meanwhile, the horse ride round the park was enjoyable but again seemed a little rushed. we visited santa on our final night. the village centre is beautifully decorated for christmas and the decor in the grotto was nothing short of first class. however, it simply felt like a conveyer belt, with guests crammed into the grotto to wait in a queueing system which lasted at least 20 minutes (plus the 10 minutes we waited outside. with young children, this is really poor. while santa was brilliant and we didn\\u2019t feel rushed once inside the room, the wait really spoilt the event for me, and again suggested cp had massively overbooked this event. we would return but wouldn\\u2019t bother booking activities next time.\n",
      "2018-03-11 00:00:00 we stayed at center parcs over a long weekend at the end of february. our booking was last minute, but we paid an extra \\u00a350 to stay in the pines area (as we had our 19 month daughter with us so wanted to be near the plaza).arrival was slow - it took over 40 minutes to get to the check in lodge after joining the queue, which was a little frustrating. however, we found our lodge to be clean, fully equipped and comfortable for our weekend. the park is kept in an excellent condition, the lake area in particular is quite picturesque, and there was plenty to do for kids of all ages. the pool was superb and our daughter loved it, especially the toddler pool area. changing rooms could be bigger but the wristbands for lockers made life a lot easier. my only real criticism concerned the heating in the lodge. on what was one of the coldest weekends of the year the thermostat was programmed to drop to 14 degrees at midnight. (they\\'re programmed centrally and times cannot be adjusted). i\\'m all for saving energy but it really did get very cold and left for an uncomfortable nights sleep; having to wake up and manually adjust the temperature every night.leaving that aside, it really was a lovely relaxing break and somewhere we look forward to returning to.\n",

      "2017-07-10 00:00:00 cost my husband and i took my father and to little children. to rent the lodge alone and bikes it came to \\u00a3675. we also booked crazy golf, woodland creations, electric boat and bowling. overall this brought the cost to \\u00a3900. add the crackle logs and little extras and it was nearer \\u00a3950. we ate out one meal a day and that added a further\\u00a3400 with drinks. \\u00a31350 is quite a lot for 3.5 days and 4 nights when you compare it to abroad but not when you compare it to hotels here and it is a huge place to maintain. foodgrande cafe- dad had half a chicken which was the size of a quail lol but he enjoyed it. hubby had chicken boursin enjoyed it. kids had generous portion of fish. not a lot of chips with any of the meals though so order extra. i had tiger prawns which was nice but \\u00a313.50 for 7 prawns and a pinch of cress to dress was shocking. it should have been listed under starters but main! i left still hungry. food took 50 min to arrive as cooked fresh so probably best not to go there if you\\'ve young children. total meal was not far off \\u00a3100 with drinks and sides. pancake housenot bad value for money and it is was it is. they don\\'t seem to do the chilli beef one which used to be my favourite. hucksok so for 3 adults and one child with two desserts and 4 drinks it came to \\u00a3101 plus tip. the waitress was fantastic and really helpful as one child has an allergy so she pointed out the \\'safe\\' food. great activities for kids. service good considering it was about 5.30pm. the ribs, double double burger and desserts were delicious: torte and sundae. sports barabsolutely appalling value for money. i had salmon and roasted veggies which was about \\u00a316: it was nice enough but not a huge portion and only 2 tiny potatoes. hubby had ribs for about \\u00a314 but they came in a small bowl on its own so he had to order extra sides. he did enjoy them but it was more of a snack than a main meal. the fish and chips were ok. overall cost about \\u00a375-80.lodgewe like the lodges: they are practical, functional and cosy. the beds are comfortable and you pretty much have everything you need; a couple dishwasher tablets; a sachet of fairy liquid; sachets of tea, coffee,sugar and milk; a tea towel; scourer and dishcloth; 2 loo rolls per toilet; bath towels and hand towel per person. you need extra of it all really but it\\'s nice to receive these helpful gifts. just remember him bags and pedal bin liners. the lodge was surface clean. the skirtings and behind sofa filthy and our bathroom sink had lost its enamel and was stained which was a bit unsightly. the heating also did turn itself off a lot and we only tried to put it on a couple times to take the edge off the cold. it had been really hot outside during the day but in the middle of the night it got quite chilly. activitiescrazy golf- upon arrival we were told the second half of the course was closed but we could go around twice; no offer of refund though. it was too busy to go around twice and would have been waiting for hours for other groups to move to each hole. good fun but a bit difficult for a 3 year old really. electric boat- expensive and restful! not really our thing as too slow even for my 3 year old who promptly told me afterward that we mustn\\'t go in that again lol. peddle boats are cheaper and more fun. woodland creations- good value for money. really friendly staff and you get to take home what you make. bowling-had to cancel due to poorly child with less than 24 hours notice. we were shocked that the policy was 75% refund with 48 hours notice or 25% refund if 24 hours notice but they kindly gave a full refund due to circumstances as we were leaving next day and couldn\\'t reschedule. maybe best not to book things in advance?poolalways have a fab time. swimming facilities are amazing especially with the new infant section though there is a cold draft that comes from somewhere so not nice for parents who have to stand around out of the water. they could have done with a deeper bit where the parents could sit with the babies and keep warm. the showers kept going cold and we ended up not bothering. first part of rapid was closed but it can\\'t be helped when things need repairing. summarywe always have a great time and have fond memories. wish eating out and activities were more reasonable but we still recommend it to friends and family.\n",
      "2016-05-13 00:00:00 the cabin:we stayed in pine log cabin which was perfect for a small family. starting to look run down but you don\\'t want something to posh with young kids or you won\\'t relax. furnished with everything you need including a couple of dishwasher tablets and sachet of fairy liquid but could have done with bringing more from home. don\\'t forget loo roll, cling film, salt pepper etc if you intend cooking. vouchers:burst pipe first night resulting in pool and restaurants closing but center parcs gave everyone \\u00a350 voucher which was very kind and more than fair. bike hire:we hired bikes and mine was electric which was a godsend given that i\\'m heavily pregnant. well worth the investment as i managed to get around the vast grounds without any effort at all. couldn\\'t stop giggling as i\\'ve overtook my husband on his bike carrying our toddler. rain:it poured with rain for the first few days but still had a fab time. it was a real adventure splashing about on our bikes on the various trails and we loved swimming in the outdoor pool with the rain lashing down: very invigorating. you can spend all day in the pool with many different areas and rides suitable for everyone. my toddler loved the kiddie area and we also had a scream going down the flumes together. they even provide buoyancy aids free of charge which is helpful. lake:the last day was glorious sunshine and we spent most of our time on the beach by the lake. the kids played in the maze then splashed around in the water where loads of carp swam to the surface almost beaching themselves. electric boat ride for 4 people was beautiful and very relaxing too. food:cafe rouge was good food and relatively good value for money. tues was steak night and both my husband and i thought it was the best we had in years. huck american diner was ok but not value for money at all. i had macaroni cheese which was served in a dish the size of a large slice of toast and about 2inches deep. for \\u00a312.95 i expected larger portion and some secret ingredient to justify the price. my husband had a double burger and small chips in a little tin cup which was \\u00a316.95. he said it was nice enough but not worth the price. we had side dishes and drinks on top of this which we had to pay extra for. pancake house is great but id opt for a small if you want room leftover for a sweet pancake. beware of the chairs as you shuffle closer to the tables; i caught the back of my ankle on the low foot bars on the chairs twice and really hurt myself. another lady did the same thing sat opposite me so there\\'s definitely a design flaw. been to various center parcs all around the country and will be going again. it can be expensive but if you take your own food and bikes as well as stick to using the pool daily then it\\'s is great value. you do have to pay for everything else and soon adds up. we also had an amazing day at longleat safari park 5 mins up the road which was well worth a visit despite the pouring rain. we saw everything but didn\\'t queue once!\n",

      "2018-12-27 00:00:00 just back from an amazing christmas spent at cp. we\\u2019ve been to several of the cps over the years but this was our first christmas spent there. it didn\\u2019t disappoint. from the moment we arrived until we (reluctantly) left it was fantastic.we are a small group of 2 adults and a 10 year old child so we\\u2019re a little anxious that we might have felt swamped by large groups celebrating but we never felt anything other than part of the celebrations.the park itself was decorated beautifully. we were in pine area so very close to the plaza and fortunate to be located right on the main walkway with its amazing lights in the trees. the staff did a great job all over the park to make it feel very festive.every member of staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and went above and beyond to make sure we had a good christmas time. we did lots of festive activities;- breakfast with santa on christmas eve in hucks was really good. balloon animals, presents, visit with santa who also walked round the tables, reindeer food to leave outside your lodge etc etc- santa\\u2019s workshop was really good fun and well organised. i\\u2019m fairly sure my daughter doesn\\u2019t believe and this was her last year of visiting santa but it was definitely a good way to end the fairytale. the photo and gift are included which was lovely- horse and carraige ride was lots of fun even though there was a slight galloping incident with the carraige before us. the lady who was \\u2018hosting\\u2019 was very enthusiastic.- carol service in the venue was good but unfortunately our daughter was a little bored so maybe better for the adults- pantomime. so funny that we spent the whole 2 hours laughing. i\\u2019ve seen some big polished pantos over the years but i think this was my favourite. buttons was hilarious.- christmas quizmas this was quite good but ran on a little too long - aqua jetting whilst not a christmas activity still our favourite and the instructor was really good fun. we do this activity every time and we all love it.all the usual cp activities were on offer but we didn\\u2019t get the time to do anything else as we spent most of the rest of our time in the pool. after 5 long sessions both my husband and i are were exhausted, bruised, aching and sore but when asked by our daughter for another trip down the rapids we both eagerly did it again. really good fun and she\\u2019s such a water baby she could be entertained there for ever more. the new slides were really good and hardly any queuing even though it was very busy all the time.we decided to completely buck the christmas trend and had a bbq instead. not sure if i was 100% happy with this but a nice change. although now we\\u2019re home i\\u2019m yearning for a christmas lunch with all the trimmings.for the first time we didn\\u2019t take or hire bikes. we thought the weather would be bad and we had paid extra to be close to the plaza (knowing that was were we would spend most of our time). we did however manage to log record breaking steps and used the train. we have already been online to get our next christmas at longleat sorted. it really was one of the best christmasses ever and definitely one we won\\u2019t forget.\n",
      "2017-07-07 00:00:00 we have just arrived back from a mid week break at longleat and i cannot fault our whole stay. from the staff at arrivals to the staff at the booking points everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. all the staff in the restaurants were very nice and took extra time with our 8 year old daughter. we received excellent service at the pancake house especially and the waffles were to die for. the pool area is great fun and we spent hours riding the rapids. we hired a cabana for a morning which was a nice treat and gave us somewhere peaceful to escape to. the water is lovely and warm the lifeguards are friendly and helpful. we booked an aqua jet session and it was so much fun, my husband and i probably had more fun than the children. mike the photographer was really good and managed to get a good group photo of us.my daughter did the junior quad biking and the instructors were really patient and fun. they were careful to boost the less able and gave them as much time as they needed. our daughter absolutely loved her session and will definitely be back.geocaching was good fun and well organised just a shame it was so hot (not moaning about the weather it just made racing around up and down hills a bit hot and sweaty) we did however manage to come second so we were really pleased. the high ropes was great fun and the zip wire across the lake was fantastic. just one hint to cps - youre missing out on a fantastic photo opportunity as there is no way to get your own and everyone wants to capture the moment. again the instructors were patient, friendly and helpful.the land train is essential if you have anyone in your group who struggles to ride bikes up steep hills. our daughter is a strong cyclist but she struggled and we used the train a lot. we were always able to get a seat and the drivers make a special effort to beep their horn and wave at the small children which they loved.the lodges are spacious and clean, everything you need and the blackboard provided us with lots of silly games. one tip - if you have someone who struggles with hills then choose a lodge near the pool plaza or jardin de sports for convenience.lots of people complain about the cost of cp but we\\'ve always found it to be reasonable considering what you get for your money. it\\'s a lovely break in a lovely natural resort with lots of wildlife, we saw so many deers, rabbits, squirrels etc that we were all enthralled. the pool, play areas and walks/rides are numerous and entertaining. if you want a bargain break maybe one of the other uk holiday resorts is for you but you get what you pay for in my opinion.we already online getting our next holiday booked.\n",

      "2016-03-02 00:00:00 the executive lodge is amazing, well spaced and laid out. definitely designed like a home away from home. log fire is highly recommended on a cold evening :-). cleaners did a great job as well. the only downside is, it is very expensive. we will definitely be heading back at some point though\n",

      "2018-02-07 00:00:00 this years cp trip was with my brother and sisters and our significant others! the main reason for our trip was coming across this fantastic cheap week - we are all in the process of paying for houses, weddings &amp; university so the aim of this week was to spend minimal! after selecting our mon - fri trip for a great price we had a woodland lodge, we were pleased with the how clean and equip the lodge was as usual and very thankful for the kind people before us who left a bird feeder on the patio! after buying some reasonable priced bird feed in the parc market it made a wonderful viewing of all sorts of birds coming down for a feed. so the villa was excellent as usual. half of the party hired bikes that were all in great working order and served their purpose, my boyfriend hired a electric bike (lazy i know) but i have to say it was amazing, he zoomed up the hills and i tired to remind myself that its good to raise the heart beat and struggle up 10 minutes behind him! but thats part of the fun. so bikes overall amazing service and brilliant quality.we visited the foresters inn on the first day for lunch which was lovely, great customer service and drinks, it was a good start to our holiday.the swimming pool...... we were so pleased with the new slides! they were great, the staff were very informative and supporting and only took the mickey when i screamed the place down once or twice. the rest of the pool was fantastic as usual thank you swimming pool team!we visited the jardin des sports every day we played squash, badminton, table tennis, pool, and yoga and all were fantastic. the booking app was very easy to use and i defiantly recommend, it was great for last minute bookings in the morning for courts. starbucks coffee was lovely too and normal priced. bowling was a good laugh and the cocktails were great, good customer service and no faults with bowling a great afternoon. we also played adventure golf on a sunny after noon which was perfect too. the cakes in the parc market!! if your on a diet do not go close to them.... they are amazing! we visited las ignnes for cocktails and then back for dinner which was lovely, great food, drink and service along with the pancake house a good experience for our last meal on the friday before driving home. lastly i just wanted to mention the great family quiz, it was great! very well organised, easy to follow and good variation of questions, children can get involved as well as the oldies. it\\'s the second time i\\'ve done it and it gets better and better!overall thank you cp for another wonderful trip, many memories made and i cannot wait to return.\n",
      "2017-01-02 00:00:00 myself and my friend are centre parcs fanatics having been over a dozen times each throughout our childhood this was our first trip taking our boyfriends and they loved it! we stayed in a 2 bed woodland lodge and as usual it was clean, well equipped, modern and super comfy. my boyfriend and i drew the short straw and ended up with the twin room but after pushing the beds together it was quite nice to have some space for once! we tried some new activities this time such as aqua jetting which was a blast, we had a lot more freedom than i expected being able to explore the main pool, lazy river and slide pool after the initial lesson on how to use them. even as a adult the 30 minute session was great, we had races and lots of fun was cool to see the pool in this different way and total empty! recommend for adults and kids too. we also visited throughout the winter wonderland season which added to the trip making it extra special, the effort and time the park goes through to make the forest look great it amazing. it was great to see some many kids faces light up with all the lights and accessories around the forest. we also did the christmas carriage ride which were taken by two lovely ladies and two lovely boys - with great names the cray twins ronnie and reggie! was a relaxing experience trotting through the village, recommend for a romantic ride or a magical experience for the young hearted. of course the swimming subtropical paradise was the highlight with the rapids being the best part, they never get old and once again the christmas decorations and lights around the outdoor pool was spectacular. the restaurants were great, we ate in the new la ingenues, pancake house, dining in and dexters and were all great, good value, great service and staff. we also took part in the christmas quiz at the sports bar this was a great family quiz with lots of fun, we didn\\'t do very well but had a laugh along the way good cheap activity for families and friends. always recommend taking bikes or renting them as it adds to the great experience of exploring the forest, defiantly recommend a trip and worth every penny. thank you centre parcs for another amazing trip.\n",

      "2018-09-21 00:00:00 we returned from our second centerparcs trip today and we cannot wait to go back in may next year. the facilities are great; the pool, plaza, sports area all just what we wanted with plenty of attractions for our three year old son and us. our lodge was nicely located (pine 216) and the activities that we did were good fun. but this year we found that the people really made the difference; maisie on front desk who looked after our son when he fell over, the girl who took our son for his mini adventure (which he really enjoyed), the lady in the parcmarket who defied the weather forecast and reassured me that storm ali wasn\\u2019t going to ruin our day - it didn\\u2019t, teresa in the toy shop who let our son help her stacking shelves and then gave him a toy fire engine as a thank you. you can plough as much money as you want into a resort but the people who work there will ultimately decide on our experience, and they helped make it a fantastic and memorable break.\n",
      "2017-09-21 00:00:00 having read some reviews, understanding that there were some concerns over cleanliness and costs of things, i was hoping for rather than expecting great things. since we arrived on the monday, we have had an excellent time. we were lucky enough to have a lodge near to the car park but the arrival was smooth, the lodge was good and perfect for our little family for four nights. the pool was excellent fun, our two year old son lapped up the flumes, waves and toddler area, getting upset when we left. the plaza is a lovely environment and if you go with the expectation that it will cost you money, there isn\\'t a problem. the bella italia and las iguanas were good although hucks diner was slow service, the only disappointment. there are little touches which have made it for our son; little trolleys in the parcmarket, fish in the streams in the plaza. and it\\'s a five minute drive to longleat so he could see his first lions.a friend asked me to let them know what we thought and it will be an easy recommendation, and hopefully we will be back next september for our next family holiday. brilliant time and lots of memories made :-)\n",

      "2017-12-08 00:00:00 booked an adapted cabin as in a wheelchair and was pleasantly surprised how large the lodge was. enough room for 6 with a reserved parking space outside. log burner is a nice touch but the logs are mega expensive and only last for 1-2 hours and in the winter you\\'ll need 3 a day (\\u00a35 each log)checking in is a nightmare and you queue from the entrance gates to the check in lodge fir about 45 minutes.bikes for hire at \\u00a325 each, which were popular along with tag a longs for tiny children. mobility scooters \\u00a355 (\\u00a3200 deposit for these!!). be warned it\\'s advertised as being pedestrian friendly after cars are returned to the car park, but we nearly got run over a few times by cars being driven around the park when they should be in the locked car park, cars driving up/down the wrong way on one way roads, security totally ignored them.bikes can be a nightmare when being ridden at speed in packs around the park, keep hold of your children it\\'s not as pedestrian friendly as you\\'d like to think or advertised to be.children\\'s scooters seem like a good idea for those who can\\'t ride bikes but there is nowhere safe to leave then, they are not allowed into the villages and anywhere near the shops. facilities are great for families but not for a wheelchair, it\\'s pretty hilly and everything is so far apart, the activities are varied and cater for everyone but are mega expensive, plus some get booked up pretty quick despite the cost. (zip line is \\u00a332 each and is obviously over in 10 minutes) so for a family of 4 or 6 doing several things per day you can soon rack up a bill.the land train is great for visiting the areas of park too far to walk but you cannot access with a wheelchair nor has any space for folded up wheelchairs or pushchairsswimming is great for all the family however be warned the rapids are quite fierce and we saw a few kids being taken out by larger adults, not their fault the whirlpool is strong and difficult to get out of, lost a pair of glasses in here so i would recommend buying a strap for themrestaurants are very very expensive, plus you have to wait up to an hour for a table, families seem to hog the tables long after they have finished eating. hairdos of screaming kids with parents just happy being out of the cold drinking wine and letting the kids yell.shops are a mixed bag of general food to goods to buy for kids and general gifts. the supermarket is what you would expect for a captive audience and can be expensive but they also do their own brand goods that are reasonable winter wonderland is nice but spoilt by adults hogging the snow globe and things designed for children really. could of been supervised by staff to stop this.firework display was brilliant and worth the wait, nice touch seeing santa on the lake waving to the children, again somewhat spoiled by adults shouting and blocking views for little children, far too much alcohol and rowdywould definitely go again but would better plan to take food to eat in the lodge as you get a large fridge and freezer and can unload your car before returning it to the bumpy car park\n",

(night time slide queues around 5 minutes, day time around 15 minutes). rapids were cold first but got warmer after our 1000th time down them. village square and jardin des sports are great, especially the sports cafe and pancake house. always ignore the 1 star reviews saying that the villas are bad and that it\\'s outdated, it\\'s been around since 1994 so what do they expect, and the fact that it costs money to update. it\\'s not even outdated. always pre-book activities and arrive 15 minutes before the actual activity starts - people got turned away on climbing wall because they missed the safety talk. doesn\\'t matter how long you stay, it\\'s always a good one at center parcs.note: when we stayed a few years ago, we stayed in 573 which was quite dirty, has it had a proper clean yet?\n",

      "2018-10-17 00:00:00 this was our second visit as a couple to this site. the first time around, we loved the range of things to do on site, the friendliness of the staff and the location, but were horrified by how much mould we found in our lodge and the fact that when we raised this, we were promised contact from a manager that never came. after much debate about whether to return, i decided we were surely just unlucky last time around and so booked again. the moment we walked into the lodge, we noticed an overpowering musty smell that was worst in the bedroom. there was some mould visible on window frames and growing out from behind the wardrobes and the bed headboard, albeit nothing like as much as in our previous lodge where there were huge patches on the walls. the smell was so bad that we slept with the windows open and stored our clothes in the sitting room rather than the bedroom. it\\u2019s incredible to me that the cleaners hadn\\u2019t noticed this, as every time we left the lodge and returned, the smell hit us the moment we opened the front door. having got nowhere by complaining about the same issue last year and knowing from a member of staff at check in that the site was fully booked (so we knew we couldn\\u2019t be moved), we decided to make the best of it and did have a lovely few days enjoying everything else on the site. but it was such a shame to return each evening to a lodge that smelt like a dank student bedsit, especially having paid almost \\u00a3500 for three nights. i think the second visit has confirmed that there\\u2019s a damp problem in all the lodges of this type and we\\u2019d be unlikely to return.\n",
      "2017-10-15 00:00:00 this was our first time at any center parcs site, for my husband\\'s birthday. we\\'ve previously been to forest holidays and bluestone and had expected something along similar lines. we both commented that the site was bigger and better equipped, with a much wider variety of things to do, than anywhere we\\'ve been before and we were really impressed. also the staff are all really friendly and helpful, in every shop and restaurant you go into. now for the negative i\\'m afraid - beware lodge 234 - the place is a hazard to health. it looks lovely until you go into the bedroom, which stinks of damp and there is mould growing everywhere - inside the window frames, on the wall and even inside the wardrobes so that we didn\\'t use them at all. it\\'s unbelievable that staff wouldn\\'t have noticed this - you open the curtains and the window frames are literally covered in black mould spores. the lodge was also so grubby that i\\'m not sure it had been cleaned since the previous occupants left - nearly all the crockery and glassware had food on it, and the bathroom was really grimy too. there were also small issues such as the jacuzzi bath not working, missing items in the kitchen and doors not shutting properly, etc - small things but not what you expect when you\\'ve paid for an \\'executive lodge.\\' my husband didn\\'t want to make a fuss as it was his birthday but i did mention the mould and dirt to a member of staff on the bookings desk who asked how we were finding things - she said she\\'d never heard of a mouldy lodge before (which is strange as quite a few reviews on here mention mould in cabins) and that we couldn\\'t be moved as the site was fully occupied, but she\\'d get a manager to come down and see us. we left this morning and haven\\'t seen a manager. a shame as i\\'m really in two minds about whether to go back - we loved the site but neither of us is feeling great after three nights surrounded by damp and mould and i\\'m not sure i could risk getting an equally mouldy lodge again.\n",

      "2018-02-09 00:00:00 this was our fifth time at center parcs, and my wife and i always book a midweek break just after christmas, mainly just to relax and chill out. this year we left it a bit late booking, literally last minute, so our deal was not as good as normal. we booked a one bed apartment in the redwood block, right next to the village square. now just after booking i began reading some of the trip adviser reviews from january this year, mainly because i wanted to find out about the new water rides that opened last year. on reading the latest reviews of the park, i actually started to think maybe i\\'d made a mistake. i knew what people meant when they spoke about how cold and dirty the changing rooms were, and how expensive all the add ons are. yet i have to say on this visit, from 5th feb to 9th feb, i had never seen so many cleaners at center parcs. the swimming pools are the main attraction in my opinion, so they are busy most of the time, and the changing rooms do suffer. yet this time i was surprised at how well the staff were doing at keeping on top of it, it actually looked like the management took notice of the reviews, and all credit to them if they did. the pool area is great, the new rides just added that extra bit of thrill to the place, and as for the rapids, there best done at night when its dark, even better if its rainy.i didn\\'t think the water was to cold in the pools, you had warm areas, hot areas, and cold areas.as for our apartment, we loved it. it was more modern than the villas, more up to date. this was the first time we\\'ve had a one bed, and its perfect for couples, i did miss not having a log burner, but i understand why there not in the apartments. the kitchen is just passable, very compact, put it this way, you wont be cooking a roast in there, but then again..., why would you want to, its a break after all. the apartment was clean, tidy, and had everything you needed for a four or five day break, and as i said before, perfect location. we ate out every night, hucks, indian, bella italia, and also iguanas, and as you would expect, there not cheap, luckily i only had my wife and i to pay for. if i was taking my family there, i would definitely eat in a few times.in my opinion hucks is the worst out the bunch, not with food and service, but looking dated and tired, needs a re-vamp. iguanas and bella italia on the other hand were fab, the food the service, cant knock it, but you really do need to book in advance for these, especially towards the end of the week. we saw so many parties being turned away, even couples being turned away, every table seemed taken.overall this was our best visit, and again i have to give a shout out to the cleaning staff, not just the house keeping, but the early morning cleaners in the plaza, jardin, and all over the park, they really do a great job...thank you\n",
      "2017-02-03 00:00:00 my wife and i booked a three bed lodge for about \\u00a3250 for the mid week break (4 nights ). it was just the two of us, and we were in the oak section of the park. it was a five min walk to the jardin des sports and about 25mins to the plaza. my overall impression of the place is great, cant really fault it. people often talk about how expensive everything is inside the park, and thats true to a certain degree. but for four day we didn\\'t see one piece of little, we were treated like you would expect to be treated on holiday, and we felt safe walking around late at night as we made are way back from the restaurants, walking in the pitch black, through the trees...,great fun. the pool area is fab too, so much to do, even for an old guy like me, and as from this summer there opening more water slides, and they look impressive. we tried four restaurant on this trip, and the sports bar for brekkie too. they were hucks. iguanas,rajinda, and grand cafe, all great service, and the staff were really friendly. the food was good in all restaurants, not amazing, but pleasantly surprisingly good, i didn\\'t have a bad meal the whole time i was there. the lodge has everything you needed to survive, log fire, comfy beds, fully functional kitchen, home from home. this was our third trip to longleat, and this was by far the best. i have to acknowledge how good the staff were, for me this was the biggest improvement since last year, well done guys.\n",

      "2017-07-22 00:00:00 stayed here from 15th - 17th and my family and myself had a great time. we stayed in the basic villa, it was very clean, we had all the necessary kitchen equipment we needed. we signed up for soft tennis, high wires, and went on the boats twice. yes it is pretty expensive but we felt it was money worth spent. we attended the family quiz on the sunday night, this was a great laugh, the man running it was very funny.\n",

      "2017-12-11 00:00:00 as a family we have stayed at c.p. longleat on five occasions.firstly it has to be said the cleanliness of the site and the swimming pools are second to none.however, it does fall down on the condition of the cabins we have never stayed in one that did not have problems,the recent one having, towel rail hanging off wall,blind only closing half way,cupboard door in kitchen hanging off and a front door that had to be slammed really hard in order to secure it.vast amounts of money have been spent on a new water ride while basic repairs are overlooked.yes there are plenty of activities to keep you occupied but these are very expensive and can very easily add up to a large bill.food is also a bit on the expensive side, we found hucks is the best place to eat with a greater choice on the menu. cafe rouge in our opinion has gone down in quality and up in price.i would say to all staying at c.p take as many provisions as you can because the on site supermarket really know how to charge.the new water ride is good but i do not think it justifies the amount of hype it has been given.we rode it once, but didn\\'t think it worth the wait of 15/20 minutes to ride it again but that is just personal opinion.the land train that runs around the park really needs sorting out, once every twenty minutes is not enough,on many occasions you cannot get on due to overcrowding another train should be put into service to run every ten minutes it is a big park and can be a walk of half an hour between venues.as with a lot of places these days, it is,once the punters are in relieve them of as much cash as possible.c.p. really need to sort out the cabins they do fall short of what is expected these days,shall be giving them a miss in the future.\n",
      "2016-12-16 00:00:00 we have as a family group stayed at center parcs before and it has to be said, the cleanliness of the site and the swimming pools are excellent, great fun for all ages.the christmas lights and fake snow make a very festive atmosphere. however, there are always some niggling problems with the chalets, nothing serious but taking into account the cost of an 8 berth you would expect these things to be inspected and put right.example. bathroom door handle and lock just about to fall off. no small shelf in shower to put soap,there where 2 holes in the wall where one had been, just not replaced. small things i know, but they should be rectified. as there were 7 of us we pre-booked hucks, cafe rouge and bella pasta for lunch over the 3 days we were there. hucks was very good, a good selection on the menu and the staff where first class, very helpful and friendly,recommended.cafe rouge was a bit of a let down. on arrival the manager informed us, and i quote, &quot; there was a problem with the chefs and the standard may not be as good as expected &quot; unquote, he was correct. the service was awful as was the steak, normally this would have been sent straight back but we had already been in there ages and the little ones were booked to see santa. bella pasta was o.k.however a much better pizza could be bought in any supermarket. the visit to santa was excellent, very nicely done, the grandchildren loved him. staff on the arrivals gate again very friendly and welcoming.bar staff in general friendly and efficient. shops on the site and bars pricey, but again they have a captive audience. it is a good break, but with a little tweaking here and there it could be an excellent break.one piece of advice. take as many of your provisions as you can carry, because if you use the on site supermarket you will need to take out a second mortgage.\n",

      "2017-10-07 00:00:00 i have been visiting longleat center parcs for more than twenty years. in that time the lodges have hardly changed. the lodge we had this week was in a very tired condition. we could not even lock the front door, as it had broken. however, my biggest problem is with the massive price increases that have occurred this year. you cannot get a breakfast for less than ten pounds and the quality of the food was poor. so you are paying hotel prices for tesco basics food.the spa now is so overloaded with day trippers, that the experience was ruined for me. every sauna i went in was full. the spa used to be for paying guests. build another one for the day trippers.it is all about fleecing every penny out of you. center parcs, you are horribly greedy people.if you are visiting, bring your own food, and one of those disposable barbecues is handy.\n",
      "2016-10-11 00:00:00 our villa was a two bed executive. very comfy accommodation, with the added benefit of en suites on both rooms.although the villa was nicely appointed, it is showing its age. the kettle leaked out all over the worktop and so did the senseo coffee machine. i have been going to the longleat center parcs for about 15 years now and have noticed the decline in services and a large increase in villas. they used to have a very nice fine dining restaurant, that has now gone. their only goal these days are to fleece every penny out of you. they even charge to spin dry your swimming trunks? that is just mean.dispite the greed of the company, the resort is a beautiful place to be and the staff are amazing. we really love the spa, although they now have day trippers over-filling it on some occasions, and there are always at least two of the saunas not working properly.the food there is always nice. if a little over priced. over \\u00a312 for a breakfast? so bring your own crunchy nuts.don\\'t get me wrong, we still enjoy a break here. there is always something fun to do. i would still recommend it even though you are fleeced at every opportunity.\n",

      "2017-09-02 00:00:00 i have been going for many years. i stayed in a one bed executive villa in the pine area. this villa is smaller than the other same style villa\\'s i have stayed in. the bedroom is half the size than the others, this i assume so they can cram more villas in. the usual style has windows all around the bedroom giving lots of light and letting the forest into the room. all i could see out of this one window from my bed is a wall, so this was disappointing, the room was dark and gloomy. the parc market has become very expensive, nearly \\u00a34 for a carton of orange juice that would be half of that normally. walking around the market all i could hear was people moaning about the high prices. we did three activities, pottery which was ok having been before i felt it seemed chaotic and unorganised. the falconry was amazing, the contact with the birds and the information given was really good. i thoroughly enjoyed it. my son did target archery and again was very much enjoyed. the bowling was fun, and reasonably priced. the pool area was good, my son really enjoyed the new ride typhoon, my grandaughter enjoyed the splash park. the area was kept clean . to eat out it is very expensive. if you want to keep costs down, take all your food with you and cook in the villa.also take your alchohol. a smirnoff ice, a pepsi max and a slush puppie were \\u00a312.00 in the sports bar. the woods are beautiful, and the nature captivating its a shame that centerparcs make you bleed money at every corner.\n",

      "2018-09-05 00:00:00 just returned from our latest visit to centre parcs at longleat. as usual the facilities were good in particular the swimming pool complex which is a kids dream with its rapids,waves and shutes i think families could spend most days here and avoid the expensive activities. although expensive the activities are varied and numerous and i know my wife and the grand children were glad they did the ariel adventure as they felt a real sense of achievement. over all centre parcs is a great place for families and we are returning guests to prove it but we may not return primary due to the second of the two issues we encountered below.firstly our accommodation was dirty when we arrived and it was clear that whilst bedding had been changed other areas had been left. the worksurface was dirty and sticky to touch and the carpets had obviously not been vacumed. however it must be said the following day we had a different person on the maid service and she did clean properly. but the biggest issue with the accommodation was the smell. we were out most of first day and evening returning late and just going to bed but the next day when we came back and all windows had been shut all day the smell just hit you. i thought it was a problem with the drains and that bathroom door had been left open but it was not the cause, my wife said it was damp that was causing it and it appeared to come from bedroom. we debated if we could put up with it or ask to move and decided that the upheaval of packing everything again was not worth it as we would not be in a lot and we just kept all windows open while in, but when we got back we regretted not complaining as all our clothes and even or suitcases stunk of whatever it was. poor when you have paid for what is described as the executive accommodation.the second issue and the reason we will probably not return is the lack of any supervision or control of people using bikes in the centre. you are not allowed to use your car and it must remain in the car park so many people cycle and for most part families cycling were fine and respectful of those on foot but there was a large amount of unsupervised older children who were causing real problems. in fact on our arrival as we walked with quite a few others down the walk way to the plaza a group of about five 15/16 year olds came charging at speed between the padestrians and were only stopped when one of them skidded to avoid hitting a woman and fell off.( no apologies for laughing at him when he gingerly got up looking foolish) this was just one of many incidents i saw involving unsupervised youngsters racing through shared spaces at speed. in fact i saw one woman stopped on a bike looking at a map knocked clean off by a kid skidding around a corner. i was also confronted by two boys, again later teens, pulling wheelies down the path. i ended up on edge constantly worried the little ones would get knocked down. there is going to be an accident if centre parcs do not do something to remove the cycles from the busy shared spaces around the lake and sports plaza and on walkways. in our compensation culture i am surprised centre parcs are not doing more to protect themselves if not us! i would suggest that they add a large clear number plate to the cycles they hire out and register it to the party so if someone is effected by the rider or sees dangerous behaviour it could be reported and some form of warning given and in very bad case cycle impounded. it would be simple to require that those bringing their own bikes also register it and are given a simple laminated number to cable tie to bike.it is a great shame we will not be returning as this is a superb place for families but i can\\'t say it\\'s a safe place for families.\n",
      "2017-09-05 00:00:00 a wonderful place to visit for families although we went as just a couple and found it just as good. i can only imagine it\\'s a kids dream to stay here with so much freedom to get around in a safe car free environment. add to that the activities available and the amazing swimming pool area they must never want to get home. as i say we did not have any children and must admit felt a little out of place as most things are designed for families , but we still enjoyed every minute. we booked to visit aqua sana for an afternoon and left feeling totally relaxed. i also booked the magic show at the pancake house, which in hindsite was a mistake, as this was very much for families with small children but i can highly recommend it as it\\'s fun and funny and hearing the children howling with laughter was worth feeling a bit silly sat on our own. i can also recommend the indian restaurant on site which was excellent. my one warning would be to take as much shopping as you can as the on site shopping centre is very over priced. expect to pay at least a \\u00a31 over normal supermarket prices for most things. failing that there is a morrisons in warminster a short drive away. i would recommend centre parcs longleat to anyone. the only negative of the whole visit was the cycle centre. we may have just been unlucky but the girl who dealt with us was the only unfriendly person we met during our whole visit. she seemed to hate her job and we basicaly had two bike handed to us and she stomped off. no explanation of lights ect just walked away, we had to ask someone else where the exit was as it\\'s a big shed full of bikes and no obvious route out. but that is the only bad experience we had throughout our stay.\n",

      "2018-05-12 00:00:00 this is our third or fourth consecutive year at center parcs longleat and probably the best yet as our grandsons age 7&amp; 8 could do most of the activities on offer. they did falconry, ariel tree adventure, boating, quad biking as well as taking part in the family quiz (we came 4th!) and seeing nutty noah (brillain\\u2019t!) at the pancake house. of course, the big attraction is the sub tropical paradise swimming pool with the rapids. the new area and rides are superb and our whole family had such fun. we were three generations from age 7 to 63 and as such this is a perfect venue. the youngsters can ride their bikes safely whilst the oldies either walk or use the land train. highly recommended. yes it is expensive but well worth saving up for. we\\u2019ve already booked for next year!\n",
      "2017-04-20 00:00:00 superb accommodation - we stayed in an executive villa at longleat which had everything you could need. very quiet in the pine area, very comfy beds and spotlessly clean. we did falconry, fishing, junior quad biking, science experiments, archery, loads of swimming in the fantastic swimming complex. a great improvement this year was the restriction on cars which made it safe for the children to cycle most routes.we ate at hucks which was brilliant with a buffet for children. i had the salmon salad, delicious, so it\\'s not all burgers! we also ate at bella italia, the prawn risotto was tasty, children\\'s menu not so great.great fun at the pancake house with nutty noah show on saturday evening, although the food was pretty awful, including the savoury pancakes.overall a fabulous easter weekend. check prices though as eating out and the activities are expensive!\n",

      "2017-02-20 00:00:00 my husband daughter and i gave stayed in centre parcs longleat more times than i can remember. after being there just a matter of hours i feel a foot taller! there are no cars, you gave to either walk, cycle or use the land train no matter what the weather. there is a real feel good factor about being there. the holiday can be as cheap or as expensive as you want / need it to be. the only free activity is the pool but there are numerous parks for the children to play in and of course walking and cycling. that said if you want to go in the children\\'s school holidays the price of the villa does double if not triple in price.\n",

      "2018-05-30 00:00:00 well laid out. nice quality accommodation in a forest settings. all lodges are designed to not overlook each other. some of the lodges are quite a long way from activities so you really need a bike to get around. we typically cycled 20km a day. nice outside now area for each lodge and no end of things to spend money on. if you do everything you could easily spend a fortune. we tried the quadbikes for 4 at \\u00a3175 and last year tried the treetop assult course which was fun.good selection of restaurants and shops. not the easiest place to get in and our of as you need to park your car a long way from your lodge best to shop and bring food with you kitchens are well equipped for cooking although fridge and freezer were small so you can\\'t bring too much fresh food. lodges have heating and come with microwaves dishwasher and a fireplace. bathroom and separate wcfun at a price and quite relaxing and safe for kidsneed to watch out for some of the cyclists a lot are quite wobbly. can be quite dangerous!!\n",

      "2017-08-13 00:00:00 we have stayed every year at longleat and i think this year will be our last. my last review was titled &quot;fantastic fun but starting to get way too expensive&quot; unfortunately the prices have gone up massively and it is now no longer affordable unless you stay in and eat in all the time! the canopy bar have increased the price of a pint of beer by 50p, the food prices are very expensive and entertaining your children has become more expensive also. what really wound us up this year was that the swimming area had the first section of the rapids shut due to maintenance ( they have been shut for months i believe ) when you consider that the swimming is pretty much the only included activity in the cost of staying at center parcs then it becomes irritating. the plunge pool was shut for a couple of days and one of the slides was closed as they had re pointed the steps. sadly this will be our last visit to longleat after many years! the attached picture should highlight the daylight robbery of the drinks in the bars!\n",
      "2016-08-11 00:00:00 we have been going to center parcs for years and will continue to do so but it does come at a huge financial price. the swimming is included and is fantastic fun but almost everything else needs to be paid for. the food in the restaurants is very expensive but good quality and the activities are superb and allow you massive choice but are very costly. i hope center parcs does not keep going this way as they may price themselves out of our holiday market. eating out twice in four days and with two activities for 4 kids our extra spend was over \\u00a31000. i noticed that they are trying to squeeze money out of people in many different ways now. each villa has a chalk board in the kitchen for the kids to mess about on. they used to leave you a bowl of chalk. now they leave you some scraps and in the shop they sell the chalk with a sign saying that you have a chalk board in your villa so why not get some chalk. a little bit desperate to me! all in all a fantastic venue but ouch it hurts the pocket.\n",

      "2018-08-11 00:00:00 we have been to centerparcs about 15 times now and longleat still remains our favourite. we expect to pay over the odds for the activities - golf \\u00a325 for nine holes!!! bowling \\u00a330 for an hour! eating out - at least \\u00a370 for a family of five! however the activities are great and the food is generally good and so we pay! the accommodation though is another story - over the last few years we have observed a deterioration in the cleanliness and general look and feel of the lodges. this time our lodge smelled damp ( very unpleasant indeed!) especially when you are paying \\u00a31500 for five days! it is ridiculous and the fact that out of season these lodges are only \\u00a3400 is appalling. the towels weren\\u2019t a good quality, they smelled and lacked the ability to absorb anything! the shower curtain was disgusting - dirty and smelly. the price you pay is definitely not reflected in the quality of the lodge. we ate at bella italia and found the food to be very good with excellent service provided by chloe. we also ate at hucks - the food is ok but the kids buffet was a rip off - cold and a very poor selection. the new youngsters menu was very limited too.foresters inn was at best farcical, the food was ok but the service was - well i have never seen anything quite like it! we ordered drinks as soon as we sat down - but i had to ask for them half way into our starters. the main courses took a while to come and when we asked for tomato sauce or more cutlery as there were no knives, the young waiter smiled and said of course, never to be seen again!!! thankfully another waiter was quite astute and we did eventually get what we asked for. the kids desserts took an age to come and don\\u2019t get me started on how long it took them to notice that we had finished our food. it was definitely an experience, but not one that i would care to repeat. the staff at the parc market and in the sweet shop were lovely and the kids loved the swimming plaza. we did enjoy our time here but it is marred by the cost of the accommodation - if anything needs \\u2018sprucing up\\u2019 it\\u2019s the lodges! either that or a definitive reduction in price!\n",
      "2017-11-04 00:00:00 we stayed last week as a family of 5 and have been to center parcs many times before. we were yet again disappointed with the overall cleanliness and presentation of the villa. this is not the first time that we have found this and clearly despite other people commenting on the lack of cleanliness and tired appearance, nothing is done. for the price you pay for the accommodation, this is unacceptable. the improvements to the swimming pool are very good, ideal for all ages and the new rides are great. however, yet again some of the lifeguards are very unpleasant indeed. when we asked one what time the big rides would be opened we were told \\u2018it tells you on the website\\u2019. since coming home i have looked on the website which is certainly lacking in lots of information and i couldn\\u2019t find it! we witnessed several lifeguards being down right mean to some kids and when we asked another a question, we didn\\u2019t even get a response. perhaps further training is required in common courtesy! the meals that we had and we ate out often, were very expensive. foresters inn was a proper rip off, i felt like asking where the rest of my food was?! a sports cafe breakfast was very poor for \\u00a310. honestly you expect to pay more on holiday but these prices are scandalous!!! you pay enough for all the activities!!! the firework display was fantastic and i still love the scenery and general feel of the place, i just really wish they would invest time and money in ensuring that they give their guests what they deserve.\n",

      "2018-01-15 00:00:00 center parcs is always going to be an experience defined by weather, location on the site and whether you are doing a mid week or weekend break?a weekend break in mid january is likely to be more of a short straw than other options and that proved the case here, the minor niggles get more pronounced and the major ones whilst expected are detrimental.first lets get the review title out of the way, center parcs does like to think it has environment credentials, but that is coming across more and more as a marketing veneer, there have always been plastic straws in the restaurants and endless plastic cups being thrown away in the sauna. what took the biscuit this time though was i don\\'t think we have had plastic coffee pod machines before. even if it\\'s not a new thing it feels really regressive.if energy is going to be consumed i\\'d have rather have something better than a fairly lukewarm shower in our executive lodge, and for that matter the bottom hot tub in the main pool area seems colder than ever!next new point is wrist bands instead of keys for lodge entry but not yet payment, definite improvement, other sites allow payment via the bands as well, but not longleat.so the lodge itself, an executive in &quot;ash&quot; which makes for a good location given the hilliness of longleat, these are for up to 6 people which would make the lounge a little snug at full occupancy, but are clean, well designed and even have usb charging sockets on some of the plugs these days.however and again this is perhaps a january thing, the tvs which would have rated as awful 5 years ago, are even more seriously bad by 2018 expectations.the executive lodges in ash have their own saunas which is always a hit with us, this time ours was missing ladle and water bucket, which was hardly insurmountable.january and the weekend again means the pool is in huge demand and especially on the friday checking in day was beyond pleasant capacity.there are two new flume rides with rafts which don\\'t quite live up to their hyperbole but are quite good, and at a glance the new areas for young kids looked pretty good.food wise we had a very good meal in iguanas, i had a spicy lamb shank which was excellent, i think though in general most of the menus across the restaurants are getting a bit tired and same\\'ish, endless burgers and steaks, heck i would have been pleased to see a vegan restaurant just for the variety!on the restaurant front we failed to leave a tip at the sports cafe on our second visit, which is a first for us at center parcs! on both occasions we visited it was no where near full and so there was no issue with us hogging a table and hey in the brochure they tout this as somewhere to watch &quot;the match&quot; so it was annoying for waiting staff to constantly pester to order, to fold up and put away the menu my daughter was actually looking at, as we were not ordering at that second, and i had to call back a waitress as she starting removing unfinished bowls we were sharing without asking!i think both times we were there it was for under 90 minutes and we had a couple of drinks each and bought food. slow turnaround perhaps in a busy restaurant but surely not in a place with more of a bar environment? we capped off the break as we usually do at the aqua sana which plastic cups aside and the annoying people who can\\'t seem to read the &quot;quiet area&quot; sign on a couple of places, is always a good experience. i\\'d recommend anyone try the aqua sana once it might make you a convert to saunas.so in conclusion, not really a bad break, but nonetheless never again to a weekend in january and center parcs you do need to get a bit more with it, environment wise, restaurant wise, and even lodge wise. the number of lodges and presumably visitors has gone up over the years and there either needs to be more things to do outside of the lodges in the winter months, or more things to keep people in their lodges such as decent big screen tvs and bluray rental or streaming.i expect we will be back at some point but not for a couple of years,and not at the weekend and not in january.\n",
      "2016-10-04 00:00:00 in my experience people either love centerparcs or shudder at the thought of them, we are fairly regular visitors and so obviously we are of the former disposition, finding the idea of a few days almost total downtime in a tranquil forest location a welcome change of pace.this time we were in a woodland lodge, at the fir end of the park, these have been refurbished in recent years and are nicely done, albeit for some odd reason the dishwasher opens to block the crockery cupboard, when it would make far more sense to swap the fridge and cupboard positions.however a cupboard position is a small issue compared to the position of being at the fir end!due to the large and hilly nature of longleat, almost everywhere is a pretty serious commute, whether by bike, foot or the land train, which inconveniently doesn\\'t run until 6pm on arrival and departure days.it really is worth the extra to pay for somewhere in line or above the plaza on the park map, or you will spend many unwanted hours on a hilly commute. the spots just below the plaza are less distant, but the hill is not one for the in anyway unfit.another negative noted this visit, is that i think the restaurant prices have gone up another notch.we tend to self-cater a lot, but the kitchens are not well equipped, we had a very blunt kitchen knife, a single frying pan and not a wooden spoon in sight.often we anticipate with and bring some of our own gear, in all fairness it is rare to find anywhere that caters well for self-caterers.i\\'m sounding pretty negative so far, but we do return time after time, because it is tranquil, because the swimming is very impressive, with all the slides, flumes, whirlpool baths and indoor and outdoor areas. because the aqua sauna is worth the expense of a visit or even two. because walking round the park is enjoyable (could do with small forest paths) and because there are a lot of activities to choose from.\n",

      "2016-11-04 00:00:00 center parcs longleat is a very large place with upwards of 700 accommodation units, mostly small chalet type two and three bedroom cabins. they are spread out and so well organised and laid out that when you are in your cabin you never seem to be overlooked. it takes about 45 minutes to walk from one side of the site to the other but there is a small landtrain which takes you around the site. this is itself quite an attraction. it runs every 20 minutes from about 9 am until midnight. children can play outside and ride bikes around quite safely as no cars are allowed into the site once you have arrived. the place we most liked was the plaza with a superb swimming pool. it is on two levels and the water rapids connecting the two levels takes you outside from the upper outside pool down to the level of the lower pool. very good to ride the rapids in the dark at night. the lower pool has a wave machine. there are restaurants and cafes to eat in and a well equipped shop. not really a place for couples or singles but very good for families with children\n",

      "2018-04-06 00:00:00 went last year and thought the standard was dreadful ,this year they had done the lodge to a acceptable standard. it was very clean so praise to the housekeeping.we were unfortunate to go when the weather was not good that is when the place let\\u2019s it self down badly.i accept you have to have ruled and regulations but there change over days are a living nightmare people just trying to bide time till they can get in to their lodge.the inside areas cannot cope with all the people.everyone just hung around wet and cold would it really have hurt them if a lodge was ready to at least let them go inside to get warm and collect luggage later.we ate out for the three nights staff were excellent hucks food good the italian superb food and staff.cafe rouge l can see why the company is in trouble dreadful meal went to order one dish the waiter told us not to have as it was too fatty 10oz steak l would say as only 7-8 oz and the crepe was like eating cardboard this really did spoil our break do not really think that\\u2019s it a place to relax and enjoy especially for the price could do a lot better\n",
      "2017-04-03 00:00:00 what a shame ,many years ago our family went to longleatcentre parcs for 16 years in a row .never once could l have criticised it.unfortuneatly not now the accommodation was run down and just liveable,the whole villa needed a refurbish.the bathroom towels were practically see through,and not even any hand towels in the w.c.to cook a breakfast with pans that stuck to the food so much was virtually impossible.hot water was never available when we wanted it (perhaps we were being thick and not setting the thermal right we did try).we had ants having fun with our food on the kitchen work tops.we used the chalk they left for the blackboard to draw around the edges of the kitchen to ward off the antsthe radiators are filthy.ours in the lounge never worked.generally a run down villa,more time needed for the staff to be able to clean villas properly especially the mirrors and glass doors.attention to detail it is not.the sports facilities were still very goodeating out was a lottery not enough staff ,tables left dirty and cluttered for a very very long time .service in the italian very good especially karen.if you are in the service industry then look after your customer,for example,when we went to the pancake house in the morning 45 mins for our drinks which we had to ask for,when they did arrive the order was incorrect, when we did get the correct drinks the waitress spilt a good quarter of coffee in the saucer,she said sorry walked away leaving it like that,the milk jug was dirty ,lovely even a little hair sitting on top of the milkordered two snacks one a waffle with cream maple syrup when it arrived we noticed no maple syrup,at this stage we just wanted to get out of there.when we asked for the bill,we asked should we have had maple syrup and she said she didn\\'t know ,really,when she came back with the bill ,she agreeded it had been missed off,we still payed full amount even though the whole experience was dreadful. give this place a wide berth.to sum it all up management should start looking at what they can do to improve performance isn\\'t it what they are paid to do\n",

      "2018-03-26 00:00:00 we did a monday to friday stay in a 4 bed executive lodge, the lodge was nice and clean. the floorboards are a nightmare! so loud everytime you move on them. we did have to make our own beds when we arrived due to staff shortness(snow) but we did receive vouchers so not the end of the world! we had a \\'games room\\', i say games room, it had a pool table, and xbox in which you had to go hire controllers and old games for a deposit of \\u00a3150, and a few board games...not quite what i imagine a games room to be, but we loved the pool table. we used the sauna everyday and enjoyed that. the accomodation came with a stair gate which was an excellent touch, especially with a 11 month old and no space in car to bring one. the swimming pool is excellent, the new kids area is fab. the rapids are awesome. our 11 month old and 4 year loved it all, our big kid the 30yr old loved it even more! my only grumble is the hot whirlpool area states no under 5\\'s, so you go in there to relax for 10 minutes peace and peole are bringing babies in, small children in rings and toddlers jumping around. the staff shoud clamp down on that. we ate in hucks for the actual 30th meal and that was very good. we all enjoyed that. hucks is a must. the magic show at the pancake house was very good, weve done that twice now and our 4 year old loves it. the new foresters inn, bit disappointing. food was lovely, took a while to come out but was very good. forgot 2 of the bits we ordered but they came out quick with apologies. my sister in law ordered some cocktail...\\u00a310.95! this place is very expensive. ham egg and chips was \\u00a312. \\u00a33.50 for 4 onion rings! not fussed bout rushing back. sports bar has gone down hill, we much prefer how it used to be, the food was tasty but there used to be mich better choices. it feels chaotic, too many tvs in your face. i know its a sports bar but at the same time, its cebters parcs, peole arent there to watch sport/sky sports news all day! some of the staff could maybe learn how to smile, and should decide if theyre doing table service or not...not just when they feel like it. bella italia was good, food was very tasty and service was good. only thing we did complain about was 2 desserts we ordered we inedible. was supposed to be warm doughnut strips...you could literally snap them in half. they were removed from the bill. we asked for the bill 3 times and the guy never returned, eventually we asked another staff member who then brought the card macgine over. so a good start and middle with a disspointing end. we did the junior pony ride, again, expensive for what it is but our little one loves it, so i guess it worth it. segways was good fun, would recommend them. after a short training section, the instructor then takes you out round the park which is fun. we love coming to center parcs and have been coming for many years. although the last 2 visits i have really noticed a price increase. center parcs has always been expensive, but it seems to have reached a whole new level. quite a few things with out of order signs too. and as others have commented...too many cars still around. people think they can do whatever they want and ignore the rules, ruins it for others. overall, we had a great time and really enjoyed ourselves, just disappointed by how much everything costs. for example, next year our little one will be at school and if we want to come back itll have to be half term.....the price for accomodation is literally double.(this is more of a general grumble as everywhere is the same) utter joke.\n",
      "2017-09-30 00:00:00 we booked a 7 day break to celebrate my 30th and my mums 60th. so 5 adults, a 3 yr old and a 5 month old. we like others were only told of rapids closure 6 weeks before we went. we complained and got a response of sorry but maintenance needs to be done and new rides are open. yes id rather maintenance be done than go down the rapids and injure myself or kids etc. still some vouchers for dining or activities would have been nice, but nope they just dont care. the number of things broken and out of order was a joke, i got bored of seeing broken signs! the new rides.....nothing like they are made to sound....fantastic light and sound experience?? we did them about 5 times on different settings and saw no lights or sounds. 1 fork of lightning at one point but otherwise very disappointing. and i definately didnt feel safe in the raft and after reading other reviews and seeing people fell out i can see why! then the lift broke so you carry your own raft up a lot of stairs....great for an asthmatic! the new rides opened in august and a month later its broken. great!the new sports bar is nice but the menu is bad, you can choose from 6 main meals...used to be so much better. we used to eat there all the time, we ate there once this time. the prices are ridiculous....\\u00a311 for a club sandwich! we tried las iguanas for the first time....very nice but once again very pricey for what you get. my partner tried to order their mexican draft beer....out of stock. bella italia he tried to order their italian draft beer....out of stock....lasagne....out of stock. not great at all. hucks...an american restuarant, their american wine, out of stock. seriously center parcs, need to get your act togeher. paying extortionate prices for what??? their prices have all gone up but the products arent worth the money. we tried to do paddle boarding but because we hadnt done it before we would need to do the training course first. \\u00a325 per person to learn how to stand on a board....um no thanks. so we missed out on that because center parcs wants to grab as much money as possible. my little 3 yr old absolutely loved it, she did the pony ride and animal magic. she loved the swimming pool. new kids area is really good. magic show at the pancake house was really good, we really enjoyed that. accomodation was good, no maid service for a 7 day stay though. we had to hoover ourselves! just what you want on holiday.overall we had a fantastic time because we were together. we enjoyed our activities, segways, field archery and the kids ones. just so expensive. we loved the swimming and see oir little girl so happy and enjoying her holiday definately made our holiday better. we missed the rapids and thinl the way its been handled it disgusting customer service. we will go back for my other halfs 30th but if things stay as they are we will seek other holidays elsewhere. which is a shame as we love center parcs but are not willing to pay so extortionate prices for substandard products.\n",

      "2018-04-21 00:00:00 just returned from an excellent midweek break at center parcs longleat forest. i\\u2019ll start by saying that longleat is our favourite center parcs village \\u2013 we love the very varied terrain &amp; the giant redwoods throughout the village make for a much more thrilling forest environment than just the normal pine trees. just a note to readers \\u2013 the terrain is very hilly in places and will certainly not suit all guests, particularly those with mobility difficulties. the fir / west-side area is definitely the most picturesque with lots of giant redwoods, but is a good 20-25min walk from the plaza (where the pool is) \\u2013 especially if you have young children in-tow. nb: you can get from fir (or west-side) area to pine (on pretty much the same level as the plaza) by taking the wessex way cycle path \\u2013 pedestrians can use it too. it takes out the big descent to the watersports lake &amp; then the ascent up the boardwalk to the pancake house / village square area. there is a land-train that runs every 15mins throughout the day to help with the hilly terrain. we stayed in pine 145 \\u2013 a new woodland 2 bedroom lodge. looked like this lodge had been refurbished fairly recently as it was in very good condition inside &amp; externally out on the patio. the painted walls by the patio looked very fresh / spotless and the brick-bbq stand also looked very new. inside the oven was practically brand-new as there was not a mark inside it from cooking stains. (no disrespect to center parcs housekeeping, but i bet they don\\u2019t get time to give ovens an \\u201cas new\\u201d clean on changeovers twice a week). the frying pan was also brand new too with no scrapes / markings on the non-stick coating. the lodge was more than clean enough, warm enough on the one day we needed a bit of heating &amp; the beds were very comfortable. we all slept very well, doubtless due to the more than normal exercise through walking / cycling / swimming (&amp; possibly a drink or two!) and also the lack of light pollution at night in the forest. would definitely choose this lodge again as it\\u2019s a 5min walk to the car-park and only an extra minute or two to the plaza. we ate out &amp; had drinks in the jardin des sports (which they are currently renaming the sports plaza) which was a comfortable 20min walk there (as downhill) / 25min walk back (as uphill on the boardwalk). longleat forest has moved over to the new rfid key wristbands that center parcs use in some villages &amp; these are a huge improvement. the key opens your lodge &amp; operates the pool lockers. you get one key per bedroom as standard, but i believe you can get extras for a charge of \\u00a32 per wristband (unsure if this is refundable as there was no village information guidebook in our lodge, just a promo-magazine). in the warmer months, two people could probably share a locker in the pool, but in cooler months with increased outerwear, you\\u2019d probably need a locker each &amp; i would hazard a guess a wristband can only control one locker at once \\u2013 so you have to pay for extra wristbands. we swam three times and never found the pool over busy \\u2013 the slight exception being with towards the end of our visit on the friday morning. departing guests must vacate their lodges by 10am on the friday\\u2026 and the pool opens at 10am. arriving guests can arrive from 12noon to use the facilities. we vacated the pool at about noon and went to the jardin des sports for lunch \\u2013 as we walked back past the plaza (circa 13:30) it was heaving as you had the mix of departing guests staying on for the remainder of the day &amp; early incoming guests making the most of their first day. was quite glad to be heading for the car to drive home to be honest. only other comment about the pool is \\u201cwhy do they feel the need to pump that cold water into the start of the rapids on the left hand side?\\u201d \\u2013 you hear loads of people commenting it\\u2019s cold and it must cool down the outdoor pool a bit too. is it to cool the rapids down so people spend less time in the pool, thus increasing capacity? (cynic view on!) we took advantage of the fantastic weather we had (anything up to 26c in mid april) and ate in a lot (bbq\\u2019s). we did eat out on the last night at rajinder pradesh \\u2013 we approached this with mixed opinions having read reviews on tripadvisor. we were, however, very impressed. the food was excellent, even if the portions were a bit smaller than our local indian restaurant (and more expensive needless to say). one of our party ordered a curry to be made madras hot and it was way too hot for him \\u2013 he likes hot food too \\u2013 so you have been warned. service was a bit hit &amp; miss at times, i.e. 15mins for them to notice empty glasses and offer refills, but the meal as a whole was good. would definitely return to rajinder pradesh on a future visit. on-village pricing is generally high, but there are exceptions. in the bars, expect to pay circa \\u00a35 a pint of beer/lager and \\u00a36 for a glass of wine, so they are taking the proverbial a bit here. in the parcmarket, if you look closely, some stuff is priced the same as your local sainsburys / tescos (some stuff even slightly cheaper), but an awful lot is a lot more expensive. we just had a big ocado delivery \\u2013 taking advantage of all their offers \\u2013 delivered on the day before we departed for longleat. the biggest rip-off in the parcmarket is for firelogs, disposable bbq\\u2019s &amp; alcohol. get your firelogs &amp; disposable bbq\\u2019s at the likes of wilko\\u2019s / b&amp;m bargains / another similar retailer beforehand and take them with you &amp; take as much of your own alcohol as possible \\u2013 you\\u2019ll save a lot just here. if you take your own bbq\\u2019s, don\\u2019t forget the matches to light them\\u2026 they\\u2019re about 35p a box in a normal shop, but 90p in parcmarket. if you are planning on self-catering in your lodge, think about everything you will need &amp; take it with you from home to save money \\u2013 include salt, pepper, cooking oil, kitchen roll, condiments etc\\u2026 yes, you are literally taking a lot of your kitchen cupboard with you. the one huge negative for us about this visit was the cycle hire centre. queued up on the monday to collect bikes. i\\u2019d pre-booked a premium mountain bike, which required a \\u00a350 deposit to be paid. was referred to the till to pay the deposit which was done and it then took the young lady serving me close on 30mins to produce a premium bike. it was quite cool at the time, so she probably enjoyed waiting in the workshop chatting to a colleague in the warm. eventually a bike was produced and during our stay we noticed how bald the rear tyre was in places (photos attached) if it was a car tyre it\\u2019d probably fail a mot. mentioned this on return and the guy could not have been less interested \\u2013 just said \\u201cthere is some tread\\u201d\\u2026 yes, but next to nothing \\u2013 could barely feel said tread with my fingers. the offending bike barcode number is d4179. told him i would put the pics on tripadvisor and he did not look happy. so apart from the cycle-hire service glitch, this was very enjoyable visit to longleat forest &amp; we were very lucky with the weather (apart from on the monday). we all have the sunburn to prove it. we are already booked to return to longleat in october as it\\u2019s our favourite center parcs village. the one village we will never return to is sherwood as they have ruined it by cramming in accommodation on every available piece of land. (yes, the accommodation count at longleat has been increased, but due to the terrain changes it has been done way more sympathetically and you can still see lots of open space \\u2013 as per the center parcs tv ad). so thanks to the longleat forest staff \\u2013 we had a great time. the cycle centre staff need a gentle nudge, as does that cold water going into the rapids in the pool. other than that, we\\u2019ll see you again in october &amp; we know exactly what to bring with us as we\\u2019re experienced visitors so know how to avoid the rip-off parcmarket.\n",
      "2016-04-22 00:00:00 have just returned from a fantastic midweek break at center parcs longleat forest. i\\u2019ve only visited sherwood, elveden &amp; longleat center parcs \\u2013 this being our first trip to longleat and it is by far the nicest of the three villages in our opinion. the forest setting is stunning \\u2013 as are the redwoods. do note that this village is very hilly compared to the others \\u2013 you will have fun on the bikes going uphill. we stayed in a pinewood apartment so were about a minutes walk from the plaza. the apartment itself was very comfortable &amp; warm. there is a small kitchen area in the apartment and you could easily prepare a meal should you want to. we\\u2019d prebooked the breakfast voucher offer and had excellent breakfasts at caf\\u00e9 rouge each day. a full english breakfast there set us up for the day and we did not want much at lunchtime as a result. the sports caf\\u00e9 had a good selection of light bites which suited us after the breakfast. can also highly recommend the pizzas in strada \\u2013 they were excellent. activity wise, we did not do a lot compared to some people. we hired bikes and must have been just about everywhere possible in the village several times over. as above, the hills make for some very varied riding depending on which way you are going! we did the aerial adventure (basically a \\u201cgo ape\\u201d type activity) and this was great fun \\u2013 the finale being a zip-wire across the watersports lake. we only swam on three occasions. the subtropical swimming paradise, whilst very good, had us bored after an hour or so on each visit. there are only so many times you can do the wild water rapids / waterslides before they lose their appeal a little. i know center parcs has fairly high occupancy levels year-round, but longleat did not seem over busy. we had no problem getting into any restaurant for our evening meals without a reservation. similarly, the swimming paradise was never over crowded &amp; queues for waterslides were short or non-existent. all the staff we came across were a credit to center parcs. the pool lifeguards possibly less so, but they have an important safety job to do \\u2013 you can hardly be all smiles when you\\u2019re telling someone not to do something dangerous. we did have maintenance issues with our apartment. the dishwasher was not plumbed in under the sink &amp; the bathroom towel rail did not work at all \\u2013 which made drying towels &amp; swimwear fun. we reported both and the dishwasher was fixed that day. the towel rail was not fixed during our stay \\u2013 we followed this up and the lady at guest services said they had to get an external contractor in. not sure i believe this \\u2013 given that there are 900 odd villas / apartments in longleat forest, they are claiming they don\\u2019t have an in-house plumber or two who can look at central heating issues? the final thing to warn people about is the parc market. the prices they charge in there bring tears to your eyes &amp; wallet. the only thing they don\\u2019t grossly overcharge for is newspapers \\u2013 doubtless only because they are bought in with the price printed on them. bring your own food &amp; drink and you\\u2019ll save a fortune compared to paying parc market prices. if you do need more food, hop in the car and there is a morrisons in warminster which is only a few miles away. so all in all a very good short break at longleat. we will definitely be back again sometime in the future.\n",

      "2016-12-06 00:00:00 this was a family holiday for my mums birthday , we come most years , we came back this year as had a few problems with our lodge last year and we were given a voucher so put it towards our next holiday . this years holiday was great as always but again when we arrived our lodge looked like it had not been cleaned and they had left us a complimentary box of chocolates as it had been noted from last year we had a problem. so my sister went straight up to the reception to note a little complaint , honestly we really aren\\'t complainers but you\\'d of thought it would be clean . but turns out what had happened was the workmen had gone in after the cleaners and layed a new carpet in one of the rooms and had left it all dusty and dirt all over the floor , so the poor cleaner had to come back again . but it was rectified and all was well, we had a fantastic stay , we do love it here . all the staff are friendly and plenty to do . the spa is well worth a visit we had an evening spa it was quieter then snd it was lovely . we will return again . thank you centre parcs .\n",

      "2016-05-03 00:00:00 our accommodation was excellent, very clean and tidy with daily service. we had two faults with our villa which were repaired and or renewed within a very short time with no inconvenience to us or the children. every member of the longleat team were great and a credit to centre parcs.my granddaughter and i both did the aerial adventure twice. my granddaughter enjoyed it so much last year we had to do it twice. this is what she has to say, &quot;i thought aerial adventure was great. the people are very trusting and they always help you. chris helped me and i sped through the course thanks to him. also i absolutely loved the zip wire at the end. it was great.&quot; jessica 9yrs\n",

      "2017-04-14 00:00:00 this was our 8th visit to longleat and it definitely didn\\'t disappoint. we stayed in a woodland lodge accommodation (comfort plus) that was located in the \\'fir\\' zone, given we have a dog. the lodge was lovely, left clean and tidy as usual when we arrived, and with lots of features that made our stay enjoyable. in terms of food, we have previously eaten pretty much everywhere, however for this weekend stay, we visited rajindra pradesh, which had an expansive menu and lots of choices for all sorts of people (children, indian lovers etc). we also ate at the sports bar one night, which featured excellent and speedy service, and decent food to go with it. our last night we ate at the grand cafe, on a sunday, so we ordered the carvery, which was fantastic! the grand cafe wasn\\'t as busy as some of the other restaurants which was nice, and the food was of excellent quality. regarding activities, we did paintballing one day and falconry the next. paintballing at center parcs was our first experience of the sport, and have to say, the staff made the experience a brilliant one! i would definitely recommend going paintballing, we played several different games and were given the chance to buy more paintballs if we wanted (although we found 200 for the whole activity was plenty). falconry was equally good, we were able to meet an eagle, kestrel, and a hawk which was amazing! there were only 4 of us doing falconry at the time, so we got to spend a good amount of time with the birds, perhaps longer than one would usually spend, and were given lots of information about each type of bird.the area and environment itself is lovely at longleat, it is well-lit at night, and although we didn\\'t hire bikes this time around, bikes are a very good and quick way of making your way through the forest.in general, a lovely stay that we have come to expect from such a wonderful place!\n",
      "2016-03-27 00:00:00 this was our 8th visit to center parcs (5th time at longleat) and was expectedly a good visit.we stayed in the fir zone, as we have a dog and the location of our villa was relatively away from the &quot;plaza&quot; (main venue), albeit on purpose. spaces between the villas was generous and given it was the easter weekend, didn\\'t seem overly busy. our villa (comfort +) was comfortable, equipped with all the necessities, despite the dvd/blu-ray player not working. having a log in the fire of an evening was pleasant (available from the parc market). the wi-fi within the villa and around the whole venue worked all the time.we ate at hucks (american), sports bar and hawton\\'s (bar &amp; restaurant) and, with previous experiences in mind, our meals weren\\'t fantastic. hucks as always provided a wide range of food, the sports bar the same however hawton\\'s had a limited menu (especially for vegetarians) and the food was average at best. in theory, the eating venues around the area need re-vamping - worth noting also that had we not pre-booked our meals, we would have struggled to find somewhere to eat.entertainment and \\'things to do\\' were easily available and of good nature. the land-train was busy at times, but expected and staff were perfectly friendly, helpful and informative.\n",

      "2017-09-17 00:00:00 i have been visiting center parcs longleat forest with my family since i was a baby, but this is the first trip i have organised and booked myself with friends. we had a wonderful time. from our arrival the staff were very friendly and helpful, our villa was clean and tidy, and perfect for what we wanted. it was very easy to pre-book activities online, which i did for huck\\'s, pottery painting, aqua sana and the big family quiz. despite the rapids being temporarily closed for renovations whilst we were there, we very much enjoyed spending time at the pool, and the new slides that recently opened were absolutely brilliant. four of the six people in our group did pottery painting, which we all also enjoyed and the staff here were very friendly. our meal out at huck\\'s was just wonderful. again, very friendly staff and brilliant food. a great meal had by all! we also visited las iguanas which we very much enjoyed, and the pancake house (which is an essential part of any trip to center parcs), and enjoyed wonderful food and service at both restaurants. we booked the aqua sana for 6-9 on wednesday evening, and it provided the perfect opportunity to relax and we had a wonderful time exploring all the various spa rooms which they have. we also enjoyed the big family quiz at the jardin des sports. overall we had an absolutely brilliant holiday and i am looking forward to booking my next break with center parcs!\n",

      "2018-04-12 00:00:00 we love center parcs, this is our fourth visit and we will be back next year. as soon as you park your car you feel so relaxed and away from the busy world ..the atmosphere is amazing. we take the whole family with us, the grandchildren really enjoy everything. this year we did notice the lodge was looking a little tired could do with a refurbishment, that was our only moan ...it is expensive there but if you don\\u2019t want to do any activities it would be a inexpensive weekend . can\\u2019t wait to go back !\n",

      "we\\'ve been coming for the new year celebrations at centre parcs for 9 years now, so we\\'ve seen the changes over that time and the ever-rising cost of the break. this year the biggest change was in the format of events on nye, with the impressive firework display being moved to 6:00pm from midnight and the usual conversion of the sports hall to an event venue not happening. whilst i can understand the view that the move of the fireworks to earlier allows younger children to see them, what it did do was leave a lack of any focus for adults to the celebrations after 6:15. the whole atmosphere was flat. anyway, for those not going at that time of year - there has obviously been continued investment in the park itself with lodge upgrades and new fences and pathways, but the overall offer is still the same as it always was with the addition of the flumes in the swimming complex (if you want to queue for 30 mins per ride). all of the staff are great, helpful and if they are running a specific activity, well trained and knowledgeable, however, in some areas there aren\\'t enough of them. the sports bar needs far more staff, when it\\'s full it holds hundreds of people and to have only 2 tills open is hopeless. we took to ordering 2 of everything to avoid the over 15 minute queues - and the prices for very average beer are steep. i don\\'t mean to sound totally negative as it\\'s a great holiday, we had a great time, but it\\'s not getting better and yet the prices continue to rise. it used to feel a bit exclusive because of the cost, but it doesn\\'t now, it feels like you are being milked and the people that go now are different as well - anyone going to a spa should know the general etiquette of being quiet as it\\'s a place to chill and relax, but those days have gone, with groups of guests feeling they have to reveal everything to all around in steam rooms, but again few staff, so no control of the environment. so to summarise: staff - great but not enough, activities - great, restaurants - plenty of choice but choose wisely if on a budget, lodges - good enough for what you want. so, farewell centre parcs that\\'s our last, but i wouldn\\'t dissuade anyone from trying it especially with small children who like swimming (free), but like iceland, understand you need deep pockets to get the most out of it.\n",
